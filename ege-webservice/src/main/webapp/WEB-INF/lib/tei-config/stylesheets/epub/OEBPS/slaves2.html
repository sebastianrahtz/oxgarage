            That very Infant who told the story of the capture of Boh Na Ghee
            [<em>A Conference of the Powers</em>: ‘Many Inventions‘] to 
            Eustace Cleaver, novelist, inherited an estateful baronetcy, with vast
            revenues, resigned the service, and became a landholder, while his
            mother stood guard over him to see that he married the right girl.
            But, new to his position, he presented the local volunteers with a
            full-sized magazine-rifle range, two miles long, across the heart of
            his estate, and the surrounding families, who lived in savage
            seclusion among woods full of pheasants, regarded him as an erring
            maniac. The noise of the firing disturbed their poultry, and Infant
            was cast out from the society of J.P.'s and decent men till such time
            as a daughter of the county might lure him back to right thinking. He
            took his revenge by filling the house with choice selections of old
            schoolmates home on leave—affable detrimentals, at whom the
            bicycle-riding maidens of the surrounding families were allowed to
            look from afar. I knew when a troop-ship was in port by the Infant's
            invitations. Sometimes he would produce old friends of equal
            seniority; at others, young and blushing giants whom I had left small
            fags far down in the Lower Second; and to these Infant and the elders
            expounded the whole duty of man in the Army.

         <p><span id="d26e13613">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘I've had to cut the service,’ said the Infant; ‘but that's no reason
            why my vast stores of experience should be lost to posterity.’ He was
            just thirty, and in that same summer an imperious wire drew me to his
            baronial castle: ‘Got good haul; ex <em>Tamar</em>. Come along.’
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e13619">
               <!--anchor1--></span>It was an unusually good haul, arranged with a single eye to my
            benefit. There was a baldish, broken-down captain of Native Infantry,
            shivering with ague behind an indomitable red nose—and they
            called him Captain Dickson. There was
            another captain, also of Native Infantry, with a fair mustache; his
            face was like white glass, and his hands were fragile, but he answered
            joyfully to the cry of Tertius.  There was an enormously big and
            well-kept man, who had evidently not campaigned for years,
            clean-shaved, soft-voiced, and cat-like, but still Abanazar for all that he adorned the Indian
            Political Service; and there was a lean Irishman, his face tanned
            blue-black with the suns of the Telegraph Department. Luckily the
            baize doors of the bachelors' wing fitted tight, for we dressed
            promiscuously in the corridor or in each other's rooms, talking,
            calling, shouting, and anon waltzing by pairs to songs of Dick Four's
            own devising.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e13628">
               <!--anchor1--></span>There were sixty years of mixed work to be sifted out between us, and
            since we had met one another from time to time in the quick
            scene-shifting of India—a dinner, camp, or a race-meeting here; a
            dak-bungalow or railway station up country somewhere else—we had
            never quite lost touch. Infant sat on the banisters, hungrily and
            enviously drinking it in. He enjoyed his baronetcy, but his heart
            yearned for the old days.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e13632">
               <!--anchor1--></span>It was a cheerful babel of matters personal, provincial, and imperial,
            pieces of old call-over lists, and new policies, cut short by the
            roar of a Burmese gong, and we went down not less than a quarter of a
            mile of stairs to meet Infant's mother, who had known us all in our
            school-days and greeted us as if those had ended a week ago.  But it
            was fifteen years since, with tears of laughter, she had lent me a
            gray princess-skirt for amateur theatricals.
         </p>
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e13635">
               <!--anchor1--></span>That was a dinner from the ‘Arabian Nights,’ served in an eighty-foot
            hall full of ancestors and pots of flowering roses, and, what was
            more impressive, heated by steam. When it was ended and the little
            mother had gone away—(‘You boys want to talk, so I shall say
            good-night now‘)—we gathered about an apple-wood fire, in a gigantic
            polished steel grate, under a mantelpiece ten feet high, and the
            Infant compassed us about with curious liqueurs and that kind of
            cigarette which serves best to introduce your own pipe.

         <p><span id="d26e13638">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Oh, bliss!’ grunted Dick Four from a sofa, where he had been packed
            with a rug over him. ‘First time I've been warm since I came home.’

         <p><span id="d26e13641">
               <!--anchor1--></span>We were all nearly on top of the fire, except Infant, who had been
            long enough at home to take exercise when he felt chilled. This is a
            grisly diversion, but much affected by the English of the Island.

         <p><span id="d26e13644">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘If you say a word about cold tubs and brisk walks,’ drawled McTurk,
            ‘I'll kill you, Infant. I've got a liver, too. 'Member when we used
            to think it a treat to turn out of our beds on a Sunday
            morning—thermometer fifty-seven degrees if it was summer—and bathe
            off the Pebbleridge? Ugh!’

         <p><span id="d26e13650">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘'Thing I don't understand,’ said Tertius, ‘was the way we chaps used
            to go down into the lavatories, boil ourselves pink, and then come up
            with all our pores open into a young snow-storm or a black frost. Yet
            none of our chaps died, that I can remember.’

         <p><span id="d26e13654">

            Number Five, Beetle, the night Rabbits-Eggs rocked King? What
            wouldn't I give to see old Stalky now! He is the only one of the two
            Studies not here.’

         <p><span id="d26e13703">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Oh, nothing. His colonel trusted him to take twenty Tommies out to
            wash, or groom camels, or something at the back of Suakin, and Stalky
            got embroiled with Fuzzies five miles in the interior. He conducted a
            masterly retreat and wiped up eight of 'em. He knew jolly well he'd
            no right to go out so far, so he took the initiative and pitched in a
            letter to his colonel, who was frothing at the mouth, complaining of
            the 'paucity of support accorded to him in his operations.' Gad, it
            might have been one fat brigadier slangin' another! Then he went into
            the Staff Corps.’

               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Oh, yes,’ he replied in his softest tones. ‘I was at the tail of

         <p><span id="d26e13731">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘'Twasn't anything,’ said Tertius. ‘We got into a mess up in the

            scornfully over the rug.

         <p><span id="d26e13751">

            chattering in his head, began: ‘You know the Khye-Kheen-Malo't
            expedition, when we scared the souls out of 'em with a field force
            they daren't fight against? Well, both tribes—there was a coalition
            against us—came in without firing a shot; and a lot of hairy
            villains, who had no more power over their men than I had, promised
            and vowed all sorts of things. On that very slender evidence, Pussy

            those tuppenny-ha'penny treaties, your asses of Politicals reported
            the country as pacified, and the Government, being a fool, as usual,
            began road-makin'—dependin' on local supply for labor. 'Member
            <em>that</em>, Pussy? 'Rest of our chaps who'd had no look-in during the
            campaign didn't think there'd be any more of it, and were anxious to
            get back to India. But I'd been in two of these little rows before,
            and I had my suspicions. I engineered myself, <span class="foreign">summa ingenio</span>, into
            command of a road-patrol—no shovellin', only marching up and down
            genteelly with a guard. They'd withdrawn all the troops they could,
            but I nucleused about forty Pathans, recruits chiefly, of my
            regiment, and sat tight at the base-camp while the road-parties went
            to work, as per Political survey.’

               <!--anchor1--></span>‘My pup‘—thus did Dick Four refer to his subaltern—‘was a pious
            little beast. He didn't like the sing-songs, and so he went down with
            pneumonia. I rootled round the camp, and found Tertius gassing about
            as a D.A.Q.M.G., which, God knows, he isn't cut out for. There were
            six or eight of the old Coll. at base-camp (we're always in force for
            a frontier row), but I'd heard of Tertius as a steady old hack, and I
            told him he had to shake off his D.A.Q.M.G. breeches and help <em>me</em>.
            Tertius volunteered like a shot, and we settled it with the
            authorities, and out we went—forty Pathans, Tertius, and me, looking
            up the road-parties. Macnamara's—'member old Mac, the Sapper, who
            played the fiddle so damnably at Umballa?—Mac's party was the last
            but one. The last was Stalky's. He was at the head of the road with
            some of his pet Sikhs. Mac said he believed he was all right.’

            Durbar Sahib at Amritzar, regularly as clockwork, when he can.’

         <p><span id="d26e13795">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Don't interrupt, Tertius. It was about forty miles beyond Mac's
            before I found him; and my men pointed out gently, but firmly, that
            the country was risin'. What kind o' country, Beetle? Well, <em>I</em>'m no
            word-painter, thank goodness, but <em>you</em> might call it a hellish
            country! When we weren't up to our necks in snow, we were rolling
            down the khud. The well-disposed inhabitants, who were to supply
            labor for the road-making (don't forget that, Pussy dear), sat behind
            rocks and took pot-shots at us. 'Old, old story! We all legged it in
            search of Stalky. I had a feeling that he'd be in good cover, and
            about dusk we found him and his road-party, as snug as a bug in a
            rug, in an old Malo't stone fort, with a watch-tower at one corner. It
            overhung the road they had blasted out of the cliff fifty feet below;
            and under the road things went down pretty sheer, for five or six
            hundred feet, into a gorge about half a mile wide and two or three
            miles long. There were chaps on the other side of the gorge
            scientifically gettin' our range. So I hammered on the gate and nipped
            in, and tripped over Stalky in a greasy, bloody old poshteen,
            squatting on the ground, eating with his men. I'd only seen him for
            half a minute about three months before, but I might have met him
            yesterday. He waved his hand all sereno.

            he's dead, and his body's in the watch-tower. They rushed our
            road-party last week, and got him and seven men. We've been besieged
            for five days. I suppose they let you through to make sure of you.
            The whole country's up. 'Strikes me you've walked into a first-class
            trap.' He grinned, but neither Tertius nor I could see where the deuce
            the fun was.  We hadn't any grub for our men, and Stalky had only
            four days' whack for his. That came of dependin' upon your asinine
            Politicals, Pussy dear, who told us that the inhabitants were
            friendly.

            poor Everett's body, lyin' in a foot o' drifted snow. It looked like
            a girl of fifteen—not a hair on the little fellow's face. He'd been
            shot through the temple, but the Malo'ts had left their mark on him.
            Stalky unbuttoned the tunic, and showed it to us—a rummy
            sickle-shaped cut on the chest. 'Member the snow all white on his

            the Malo'ts and Khye-Kheens were up together; havin' sunk their blood
            feuds to settle us. The chaps we'd seen across the gorge were
            Khye-Kheens. It was about half a mile from them to us as a bullet
            flies, and they'd made a line of sungars under the brow of the hill
            to sleep in and starve us out. The Malo'ts, he said, were in front of
            us promiscuous. There wasn't good cover behind the fort, or they'd
            have been there, too. Stalky didn't mind the Malo'ts half as much as
            he did the Khye-Kheens. He said the Malo'ts were treacherous curs.
            What I couldn't understand was, why in the world the two gangs didn't
            join in and rush us. There must have been at least five hundred of
            'em. Stalky said they didn't trust each other very well, because they
            were ancestral enemies when they were at home; and the only time
            they'd tried a rush he'd hove a couple of blasting-charges among 'em,
            and that had sickened 'em a bit.

            consider necessary to reprovision the fort?' I said, 'Of course not,'
            and then the lamp blew out. So Tertius and I had to climb down the
            tower steps (we didn't want to stay with Everett) and got back to our
            men. Stalky had gone off—to count the stores, I supposed. Anyhow,
            Tertius and I sat up in case of a rush (they were plugging at us
            pretty generally, you know), relieving each other till the mornln'.

            Singh, from Jullunder-way. He only grinned, and said it was all
            right. Stalky had been out of the fort twice before, somewhere or
            other, accordin' to him. He said Stalky 'ud come back unchipped, and
            gave me to understand that Stalky was an invulnerable <em>Guru</em> of

            generally got our man. Well, while I was talking with Rutton Singh I

            below the watch-tower, and in blasting the road Stalky had blown a
            hole into one side of it. Being no one else <em>but</em> Stalky, he'd kept
            the hole open for his own ends; and laid poor Everett's body slap
            over the well of the stairs that led down to it from the watch-tower.
            He'd had to move and replace the corpse every time he used the
            passage. The Sikhs wouldn't go near the place, of course. Well, he'd
            got out of this hole, and dropped on to the road. Then, in the night
            <em>and</em> a howling snow-storm, he'd dropped over the edge of the khud,
            made his way down to the bottom of the gorge, forded the nullah, which
            was half frozen, climbed up on the other side along a track he'd
            discovered, and come out on the right flank of the Khye-Kheens. He
            had then—listen to this!—crossed over a ridge that paralleled their
            rear, walked half a mile behind that, and come out on the left of
            their line where the gorge gets shallow and where there was a regular
            track between the Malo't and the Khye-Kheen camps. That was about two
            in the morning, and, as it turned out, a man spotted him—a
            Khye-Kheen. So Stalky abolished him quietly, and left him—<em>with</em> the

            off with a couple of companies on detachment: nominally to look after
            some friends of ours across the border; actually, of course, to
            recruit. It was a bit unfortunate, because an ass of a young Naick
            carried a frivolous blood-feud he'd inherited from his aunt into those
            hills, and the local gentry wouldn't volunteer into my corps. Of
            course, the Naick had taken short leave to manage the business; that
            was all regular enough; <em>but</em> he'd stalked my pet orderly's uncle. It
            was an infernal shame, because I knew Harris of the Ghuznees would be
            covering that ground three months later, and he'd snaffle all the
            chaps I had my eyes on. Everybody was down on the Naick, because they
            felt he ought to have had the decency to postpone his—his disgustful
            amours till our companies were full strength.

            Stalky in a Sikh village; sitting on the one chair of state, with
            half the population grovellin' before him, a dozen Sikh babies on his
            knees, an old harridan clappin' him on the shoulder, and a garland o'
            flowers round his neck. Told me he was recruitin'. We dined together
            that night, but he never said a word of the business at the Fort.
            Told me, though, that if I wanted any supplies I'd better say I was
            Koran Sahib's <em>bhai</em>; and I did, and the Sikhs wouldn't take my
