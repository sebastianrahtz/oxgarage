<h1 class="head">A Deal in Cotton</h1>
<p><span id="d23e4237"><!--anchor1--></span>LONG and long ago, when Devadatta was King of Benares, I wrote some
tales concerning Strickland of the Punjab Police (who married Miss Youghal), and
<a class="link_ref" href="../TheDaysWork/sonfather.html" title="YYYAdam, his son">Adam, his son</a>.
Strickland has finished his Indian Service, and lives now at a
place in England called Weston-super-Mare, where his wife plays the
organ in one of the churches. Semi-occasionally he comes up to
London, and occasionally his wife makes him visit his friends.
Otherwise he plays golf and follows the harriers for his
figure’s sake.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4246"><!--anchor1--></span>If you remember that Infant who told a tale to Eustace
Cleever the novelist, you will remember that he became a baronet
with a vast estate. He has, owing to cookery, a little lost his
figure, but he never loses his friends. I have found a wing of his
house turned into a hospital for sick men, and there I once spent a
week in the company of two dismal nurses and a specialist in
“Sprue.” Another time the place was full of
schoolboys—sons of Anglo-Indians whom the Infant had
collected for the holidays, and they nearly broke his
keeper’s heart.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4252"><!--anchor1--></span>But my last visit was better. The Infant called me up by wire,
and I fell into the arms of a friend of mine, Colonel A.L. Corkran,
so that the years departed from us, and we praised Allah, who had
not yet terminated the Delights, nor separated the Companions.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4255"><!--anchor1--></span>Said Corkran, when he had explained how it felt to command a
native Infantry regiment on the border: “The Stricks are
coming for to-night-with their boy.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4259"><!--anchor1--></span>“I remember him. The little fellow I wrote a story
about,” I said. “Is he in the Service?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4262"><!--anchor1--></span>“No. Strick got him into the Centro-Euro-Africa
Protectorate. He’s Assistant-Commissioner at
Dupe—wherever that is. Somaliland, ain’t it,
Stalky?” asked the Infant.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4265"><!--anchor1--></span>Stalky puffed out his nostrils scornfully. “You’re
only three thousand miles out. Look at the atlas.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4268"><!--anchor1--></span>“Anyhow, he’s as rotten full of fever as the rest of
you,” said the Infant, at length on the big divan. “And
he’s bringing a native servant with him. Stalky be an
athlete, and tell Ipps to put him in the stable room.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4271"><!--anchor1--></span>“Why? Is he a <strong>Yao</strong>—like the fellow Wade
brought here—when your housekeeper had fits?” Stalky
often visits the Infant, and has seen some odd things.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4277"><!--anchor1--></span>“No. He’s one of old Strickland’s Punjabi
policemen—and quite European—I believe.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4281"><!--anchor1--></span>“Hooray! Haven’t talked Punjabi for three
months—and a Punjabi from Central Africa ought to be
amusin’.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4284"><!--anchor1--></span>We heard the chuff of the motor in the porch, and the first to
enter was Agnes Strickland, whom the Infant makes no secret of
adoring.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4287"><!--anchor1--></span>He is devoted, in a fat man’s placid way, to at least
eight designing women; but she nursed him once through a bad bout
of Peshawur fever, and when she is in the house, it is more than
all hers.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4290"><!--anchor1--></span>“You didn’t send rugs enough,” she began.
“Adam might have taken a chill.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4293"><!--anchor1--></span>“It’s quite warm in the tonneau. Why did you let him
ride in front? “</p>
<p><span id="d23e4296"><!--anchor1--></span>“Because he wanted to,” she replied, with the
mother’s smile, and we were introduced to the shadow of a
young man leaning heavily on the shoulder of a bearded Punjabi
Mohammedan.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4300"><!--anchor1--></span>“That is all that came home of him,” said his father
to me. There was nothing in it of the child with whom I had
journeyed to Dalhousie centuries since.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4303"><!--anchor1--></span>“And what is this uniform?” Stalky asked of Imam
Din, the servant, who came to attention on the marble floor.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4306"><!--anchor1--></span>“The uniform of the Protectorate troops, Sahib. Though I
am the Little Sahib’s body-servant, it is not seemly for us
white men to be attended by folk dressed altogether as
servants.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4309"><!--anchor1--></span>“And—and you white men wait at table on
horseback?” Stalky pointed to the man’s spurs.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4312"><!--anchor1--></span>“These I added for the sake of honour when I came to
England,” said Imam Din Adam smiled the ghost of a little
smile that I began to remember, and we put him on the big couch for
refreshments. Stalky asked him how much leave he had, and he said
“Six months.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4315"><!--anchor1--></span>“But he’ll take another six on medical
certificate,” said Agnes anxiously. Adam knit his brows.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4319"><!--anchor1--></span>“You don’t want to—eh? I know. Wonder what my
second in command is doing.” Stalky tugged his moustache, and
fell to thinking of his Sikhs.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4322"><!--anchor1--></span>“Ah!” said the Infant. “I’ve only a few
thousand pheasants to look after. Come along and dress for dinner.
We’re just ourselves. What flower is your honour’s
ladyship commanding for the table?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4325"><!--anchor1--></span>“Just ourselves?” she said, looking at the crotons
in the great hall. “Then let’s have marigolds the
little cemetery ones.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4328"><!--anchor1--></span>So it was ordered.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4331"><!--anchor1--></span>Now, marigolds to us mean hot weather, discomfort, parting, and
death. That smell in our nostrils, and Adam’s servant in
waiting, we naturally fell back more and more on the old slang,
recalling at each glass those who had gone before. We did not sit
at the big table, but in the bay window overlooking the park, where
they were carting the last of the hay. When twilight fell we would
not have candles, but waited for the moon, and continued our talk
in the dusk that makes one remember.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4334"><!--anchor1--></span>Young Adam was not interested in our past except where it had
touched his future. I think his mother held his hand beneath the
table. Imam Din—shoeless, out of respect to the
floors—brought him his medicine, poured it drop by drop, and
asked for orders.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4338"><!--anchor1--></span>“Wait to take him to his cot when he grows weary,”
said his mother, and Imam Din retired into the shadow by the
ancestral portraits.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4341"><!--anchor1--></span>“Now what d’you expect to get out of your
country?” the Infant asked, when—our India laid aside
we talked Adam’s Africa. It roused him at once.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4344"><!--anchor1--></span>“Rubber—nuts—gums—and so on,” he
said. “But our real future is cotton. I grew fifty acres of
it last year in my District.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4347"><!--anchor1--></span>“My District!” said his father. “Hear him,
Mummy!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4350"><!--anchor1--></span>“I did though! I wish I could show you the sample. Some
Manchester chaps said it was as good as any Sea Island cotton on
the market.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4353"><!--anchor1--></span>“But what made you a cotton-planter, my son?” she
asked.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4357"><!--anchor1--></span>“My Chief said every man ought to have a <strong>shouk</strong> (a
hobby) of sorts, and he took the trouble to ride a day out of his
way to show me a belt of black soil that was just the thing for
cotton.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4363"><!--anchor1--></span>“Ah! What was your Chief like?” Stalky asked, in his
silkiest tones.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4366"><!--anchor1--></span>“The best man alive—absolutely. He lets you blow
your own nose yourself. The people call him”—Adam
jerked out some heathen phrase—“that means the Man with
the Stone Eyes, you know.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4369"><!--anchor1--></span>“I’m glad of that. Because I’ve heard from
other quarters” Stalky’s sentence burned like a slow
match, but the explosion was not long delayed. “Other
quarters!” Adam threw out a thin hand. “Every dog has
his fleas. If you listen to them, of course!” The shake of
his head was as I remembered it among his father’s policemen
twenty years before, and his mother’s eyes shining through
the dusk called on me to adore it. I kicked Stalky on the shin. One
must not mock a young man’s first love or loyalty.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4372"><!--anchor1--></span>A lump of raw cotton appeared on the table.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4375"><!--anchor1--></span>“I thought there might be a need. Therefore I packed it
between our shirts,” said the voice of Imam Din.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4379"><!--anchor1--></span>“Does he know as much English as that?” cried the
Infant, who had forgotten his East.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4382"><!--anchor1--></span>We all admired the cotton for Adam’s sake, and, indeed, it
was very long and glossy.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4385"><!--anchor1--></span>“It’s—it’s only an experiment,” he
said. “We’re such awful paupers we can’t even pay
for a mailcart in my District. We use a biscuit-box on two bicycle
wheels. I only got the money for that”—he patted the
stuff—“by a pure fluke.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4388"><!--anchor1--></span>“How much did it cost?” asked Strickland.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4391"><!--anchor1--></span>“With seed and machinery—about two hundred pounds. I
had the labour done by cannibals.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4394"><!--anchor1--></span>“That sounds promising.” Stalky reached for a fresh
cigarette.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4398"><!--anchor1--></span>“No, thank you,” said Agnes. “I’ve been
at Weston-super-Mare a little too long for cannibals. I’ll go
to the music-room and try over next Sunday’s
hymns.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4401"><!--anchor1--></span>She lifted the boy’s hand lightly to her lips, and tripped
across the acres of glimmering floor to the music-room that had
been the Infant’s ancestors’ banqueting hall. Her grey
and silver dress disappeared under the musicians’ gallery;
two electrics broke out, and she stood backed against the lines of
gilded pipes.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4404"><!--anchor1--></span>“There’s an abominable self-playing attachment
here!” she called.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4407"><!--anchor1--></span>“Me!” the Infant answered, his napkin on his
shoulder. “That’s how I play Parsifal.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4410"><!--anchor1--></span>“I prefer the direct expression. Take it away,
Ipps.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4413"><!--anchor1--></span>We heard old Ipps skating obediently all over the floor.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4417"><!--anchor1--></span>“Now for the direct expression,” said Stalky, and
moved on the Burgundy recommended by the faculty to enrich
fever-thinned blood.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4420"><!--anchor1--></span>“It’s nothing much. Only the belt of cotton-soil my
chief showed me ran right into the Sheshaheli country. We
haven’t been able to prove cannibalism against that tribe in
the courts; but when a Sheshaheli offers you four pounds of
woman’s breast, tattoo marks and all, skewered up in a
plantain leaf before breakfast, you—”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4423"><!--anchor1--></span>“Naturally burn the villages before lunch,” said
Stalky.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4426"><!--anchor1--></span>Adam shook his head. “No troops,” he sighed.
“I told my Chief about it, and he said we must wait till they
chopped a white man. He advised me if ever I felt like it not to
commit a—a barren <strong>felo de se</strong>, but to let the
Sheshaheli do it. Then he could report, and then we could mop
’em up!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4432"><!--anchor1--></span>“Most immoral! That’s how we got—”
Stalky quoted the name of a province won by just such a
sacrifice.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4435"><!--anchor1--></span>“Yes, but the beasts dominated one end of my cotton-belt
like anything. They chivied me out of it when I went to take soil
for analysis—me and Imam Din.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4439"><!--anchor1--></span>“Sahib! Is there a need?” The voice came out of the
darkness, and the eyes shone over Adam’s shoulder ere it
ceased.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4442"><!--anchor1--></span>“None. The name was taken in talk.” Adam abolished
him with a turn of the finger. “I couldn’t make a casus
belli of it just then, because my Chief had taken all the troops to
hammer a gang of slave kings up north. Did you ever hear of our war
against Ibn Makarrah? He precious nearly lost us the Protectorate
at one time, though he’s an ally of ours now.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4445"><!--anchor1--></span>“Wasn’t he rather a pernicious brute, even as they
go?” said Stalky. “Wade told me about him last
year.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4448"><!--anchor1--></span>“Well, his nickname all through the country was ‘The
Merciful,’ and he didn’t get that for nothing. None of
our people ever breathed his proper name. They said
‘He’ or ‘That One,’ and they didn’t
say it aloud, either. He fought us for eight months.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4451"><!--anchor1--></span>“I remember. There was a paragraph about it in one of the
papers,” I said.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4454"><!--anchor1--></span>“We broke him, though. No—the slavers don’t
come our way, because our men have the reputation of dying too
much, the first month after they’re captured. That knocks
down profits, you see.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4458"><!--anchor1--></span>“What about your charming friends, the Sheshahelis?”
said the Infant.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4461"><!--anchor1--></span>“There’s no market for Sheshaheli. People would as
soon buy crocodiles. I believe, before we annexed the country, Ibn
Makarrah dropped down on ’em once—to train his young
men—and simply hewed ’em in pieces. The bulk of my
people are agriculturists just the right stamp for cotton-growers.
What’s Mother playing?—‘Once in
royal’?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4464"><!--anchor1--></span>The organ that had been crooning as happily as a woman over her
babe restored, steadied to a tune.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4467"><!--anchor1--></span>“Magnificent! Oh, magnificent! “ said the Infant
loyally. I had never heard him sing but once, and then, though it
was early in the tolerant morning, his mess had rolled him into a
lotus pond.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4470"><!--anchor1--></span>“How did you get your cannibals to work for you?”
asked Strickland.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4473"><!--anchor1--></span>“They got converted to civilization after my Chief smashed
Ibn Makarrah—just at the time I wanted ’em. You see my
Chief had promised me in writing that if I could scrape up a
surplus he would not bag it for his roads this time, but I might
have it for my cotton game. I only needed two hundred pounds. Our
revenues didn’t run to it.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4477"><!--anchor1--></span>“What is your revenue?” Stalky asked in the
vernacular.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4480"><!--anchor1--></span>“With hut-tax, traders’ game and mining licenses,
not more than fourteen thousand rupees; every penny of it
ear-marked months ahead.” Adam sighed.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4483"><!--anchor1--></span>“Also there is a fine for dogs straying in the
Sahib’s camp. Last year it exceeded three rupees,” Imam
Din said quietly.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4486"><!--anchor1--></span>“Well, I thought that was fair. They howled so. We were
rather strict on fines. I worked up my native clerk—Bulaki
Ram—to a ferocious pitch of enthusiasm. He used to calculate
the profits of our cotton-scheme to three points of decimals, after
office. I tell you I envied your magistrates here hauling money out
of motorists every week I had managed to make our ordinary revenue
and expenditure just about meet, and I was crazy to get the odd two
hundred pounds for my cotton. That sort of thing grows on a chap
when he’s alone—and talks aloud!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4489"><!--anchor1--></span>“Hul-lo! Have you been there already?” the father
said, and Adam nodded.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4492"><!--anchor1--></span>“Yes. Used to spout what I could remember of
‘Marmion’ to a tree, sir. Well then my luck turned. One
evening an English-speaking nigger came in towing a corpse by the
feet. (You get used to little things like that.) He said he’d
found it, and please would I identify, because if it was one of Ibn
Makarrah’s men there might be a reward. It was an old
Mohammedan, with a strong dash of Arab—a smallboned,
bald-headed chap, and I was just wondering how it had kept so well
in our climate when it sneezed. You ought to have seen the nigger!
He fetched a howl and bolted like—like the dog in
‘<a class="link_ref" href="../../../../T/TwainMark/prose/tomsawyer/index.html" title="YYYTom Sawyer">Tom
Sawyer</a>,’ when he sat on the what’s-its-name beetle.
He yelped as he ran, and the corpse went on sneezing. I could see
it had been <strong>sarkied</strong>. (That’s a sort of gum-poison,
pater, which attacks the nerve centres. Our chief medical officer
is writing a monograph about it.) So Imam Din and I emptied out the
corpse one time, with my shaving soap and trade gunpowder, and hot
water.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4502"><!--anchor1--></span>“I’d seen a case of <strong>sarkie</strong> before; so when
the skin peeled off his feet, and he stopped sneezing, I knew
he’d live. He was bad, though; lay like a log for a week
while Imam Din and I massaged the paralysis out of him. Then he
told us he was a Hajji—had been three times to
Mecca—come in from French Africa, and that he’d met the
nigger by the wayside—just like a case of thuggee, in
India—and the nigger had poisoned him. That seemed reasonable
enough by what I knew of Coast niggers.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4508"><!--anchor1--></span>“You believed him?” said his father keenly.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4511"><!--anchor1--></span>“There was no reason I shouldn’t. The nigger never
came back, and the old man stayed with me for two months,”
Adam returned. “You know what the best type of a Mohammedan
gentleman can be, pater? He was that.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4514"><!--anchor1--></span>“None finer, none finer,” was the answer.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4517"><!--anchor1--></span>“Except a Sikh,” Stalky grunted.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4520"><!--anchor1--></span>“He’d been to Bombay; he knew French Africa inside
out; he could quote poetry and the Koran all day long. He played
chess—you don’t know what that meant to me—like a
master. We used to talk about the regeneration of Turkey and the
Sheik-ul-Islam between moves. Oh, everything under the sun we
talked about! He was awfully open-minded. He believed in slavery,
of course, but he quite saw that it would have to die out.
That’s why he agreed with me about developing the resources
of the district by cotton-growing, you know.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4524"><!--anchor1--></span>“You talked of that too?” said Strickland.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4527"><!--anchor1--></span>“Rather. We discussed it for hours. You don’t know
what it meant to me. A wonderful man. Imam Din, was not our Hajji
marvellous?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4530"><!--anchor1--></span>“Most marvellous! It was all through the Hajji that we
found the money for our cotton-play.” Imam Din had moved, I
fancy, behind Strickland’s chair.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4533"><!--anchor1--></span>“Yes. It must have been dead against his convictions too.
He brought me news when I was down with fever at Dupe that one of
Ibn Makarrah’s men was parading through my District with a
bunch of slaves—in the Fork!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4536"><!--anchor1--></span>“What’s the matter with the Fork, that you
can’t abide it?” said Stalky. Adam’s voice had
risen at the last word.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4539"><!--anchor1--></span>“Local etiquette, sir,” he replied, too earnest to
notice Stalky’s atrocious pun. “If a slaver runs slaves
through British territory he ought to pretend that they’re
his servants. Hawkin’ ’em about in the Fork—the
forked stick that you put round their necks, you know—is
insolence—same as not backing your topsails in the old days.
Besides, it unsettles the District.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4543"><!--anchor1--></span>“I thought you said slavers didn’t come your
way,” I put in.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4546"><!--anchor1--></span>“They don’t. But my Chief was smoking ’em out
of the North all that season, and they were bolting into French
territory any road they could find. My orders were to take no
notice so long as they circulated, but open slave-dealing in the
Fork, was too much. I couldn’t go myself, so I told a couple
of our Makalali police and Imam Din to make talk with the gentleman
one time. It was rather risky, and it might have been expensive,
but it turned up trumps. They were back in a few days with the
slaver (he didn’t show fight) and a whole crowd of witnesses,
and we tried him in my bedroom, and fined him properly. Just to
show you how demoralized the brute must have been (Arabs often go
dotty after a defeat), he’d snapped up four or five utterly
useless Sheshaheli, and was offering ’em to all and sundry
along the road. Why, he offered ’em to you, didn’t he,
Imam Din?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4549"><!--anchor1--></span>“I was witness that he offered man-eaters’ for
sale,” said Imam Din.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4552"><!--anchor1--></span>“Luckily for my cotton-scheme, that landed, him both ways.
You see, he had slaved and exposed slaves for sale in British
territory. That meant the double fine if I could get it out of
him.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4555"><!--anchor1--></span>“What was his defence?” said Strickland, late of the
Punjab Police.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4558"><!--anchor1--></span>“As far as I remember—but I had a temperature of 104
degrees at the time—he’d mistaken the meridians of
longitude. Thought he was in French territory. Said he’d
never do it again, if we’d let him off with a fine. I could
have shaken hands with the brute for that. He paid up cash like a
motorist and went off one time.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4562"><!--anchor1--></span>“Did you see him?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4565"><!--anchor1--></span>“Ye-es. Didn’t I, Imam Din?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4568"><!--anchor1--></span>“Assuredly the Sahib both saw and spoke to the slaver. And
the Sahib also made a speech to the man-eaters when he freed them,
and they swore to supply him with labour for all his cotton-play.
The Sahib leaned on his own servant’s shoulder the
while.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4571"><!--anchor1--></span>“I remember something of that. I remember Bulaki Ram
giving me the papers to sign, and I distinctly remember him locking
up the money in the safe—two hundred and ten beautiful
English sovereigns. You don’t know what that meant to me! I
believe it cured my fever; and as soon as I could, I staggered off
with the Hajji to interview the Sheshaheli about labour. Then I
found out why they had been so keen to work! It wasn’t
gratitude. Their big village had been hit by lightning and burned
out a week or two before, and they lay flat in rows around me
asking me for a job. I gave it ’em.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4574"><!--anchor1--></span>“And so you were very happy?” His mother had stolen
up behind us. “You liked your cotton, dear?” She tidied
the lump away.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4577"><!--anchor1--></span>“By Jove, I was happy!” Adam yawned. “Now if
any one,” he looked at the Infant, “cares to put a
little money into the scheme, it’ll be the making of my
District. I can’t give you figures, sir, but I
assure—”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4581"><!--anchor1--></span>“You’ll take your arsenic, and Imam Din’ll
take you up to bed, and I’ll come and tuck you in.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4584"><!--anchor1--></span>Agnes leaned forward, her rounded elbows on his shoulders, hands
joined across his dark hair, and “Isn’t he a
darling?” she said to us, with just the same heart-rending
lift to the left eyebrow and the same break of her voice as sent
Strickland mad among the horses in the year ’84. We were
quiet when they were gone. We waited till Imam Din returned to us
from above and coughed at the door, as only dark-hearted Asia
can.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4587"><!--anchor1--></span>“Now,” said Strickland, “tell us what truly
befell, son of my servant.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4590"><!--anchor1--></span>“All befell as our Sahib has said. Only—only there
was an arrangement—a little arrangement on account of his
cotton-play.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4593"><!--anchor1--></span>“Tell! Sit! I beg your pardon, Infant,” said
Strickland.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4596"><!--anchor1--></span>But the Infant had already made the sign, and we heard Imam Din
hunker down on the floor: One gets little out of the East at
attention.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4600"><!--anchor1--></span>“When the fever came on our Sahib in our roofed house at
Dupe,” he began, “the Hajji listened intently to his
talk. He expected the names of women; though I had already told him
that Our virtue was beyond belief or compare, and that Our sole
desire was this cotton-play. Being at last convinced, the Hajji
breathed on our Sahib’s forehead, to sink into his brain news
concerning a slave-dealer in his district who had made a mock of
the law. Sahib,” Imam Din turned to Strickland, “our
Sahib answered to those false words as a horse of blood answers to
the spur. He sat up. He issued orders for the apprehension of the
slave-dealer. Then he fell back. Then we left him.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4603"><!--anchor1--></span>“Alone—servant of my son, and son of my
servant?” said his father.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4606"><!--anchor1--></span>“There was an old woman which belonged to the Hajji. She
had come in with the Hajji’s money-belt. The Hajji told her
that if our Sahib died, she would die with him. And truly our Sahib
had given me orders to depart.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4609"><!--anchor1--></span>“Being mad with fever—eh?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4612"><!--anchor1--></span>“What could we do, Sahib? This cotton-play was his
heart’s desire. He talked of it in his fever. Therefore it
was his heart’s desire that the Hajji went to fetch.
Doubtless the Hajji could have given him money enough out of hand
for ten cottonplays; but in this respect also our Sahib’s
virtue was beyond belief or compare. Great Ones do not exchange
moneys. Therefore the Hajji said—and I helped with my
counsel—that we must make arrangements to get the money in
all respects conformable with the English Law. It was great trouble
to us, but—the Law is the Law. And the Hajji showed the old
woman the knife by which she would die if our Sahib died. So I
accompanied the Hajji.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4615"><!--anchor1--></span>“Knowing who he was?” said Strickland.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4619"><!--anchor1--></span>“No! Fearing the man. A virtue went out from him
overbearing the virtue of lesser persons. The Hajji told Bulaki Ram
the clerk to occupy the seat of government at Dupe till our return.
Bulaki Ram feared the Hajji, because the Hajji had often gloatingly
appraised his skill in figures at five thousand rupees upon any
slave-block. The Hajji then said to me: ‘Come, and we will
make the man-eaters play the cotton-game for my delight’s
delight’ The Hajji loved our Sahib with the love of a father
for his son, of a saved for his saviour, of a Great One for a Great
One. But I said: ‘We cannot go to that Sheshaheli place
without a hundred rifles. We have here five.’ The Hajji said:
‘I have untied as knot in my head-handkerchief which will be
more to us than a thousand.’ I saw that he had so loosed it
that it lay flagwise on his shoulder. Then I knew that he was a
Great One with virtue in him.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4622"><!--anchor1--></span>“We came to the highlands of the Sheshaheli on the dawn of
the second day—about the time of the stirring of the cold
wind. The Hajji walked delicately across the open place where their
filth is, and scratched upon the gate which was shut. When it
opened I saw the man-eaters lying on their cots under the eaves of
the huts. They rolled off: they rose up, one behind the other the
length of the street, and the fear on their faces was as leaves
whitening to a breeze. The Hajji stood in the gate guarding his
skirts from defilement. The Hajji said: ‘I am here once
again. Give me six and yoke up.’ They zealously then pushed
to us with poles six, and yoked them with a heavy tree. The Hajji
then said: “Fetch fire from the morning hearth, and come to
windward.’ The wind is strong on those headlands at sunrise,
so when each had emptied his crock of fire in front of that which
was before him, the broadside of the town roared into flame, and
all went. The Hajji then said: ‘At the end of a time there
will come here the white man ye once chased for sport. He will
demand labour to plant such and such stuff. Ye are that labour, and
your spawn after you.’ They said, lifting their heads a very
little from the edge of the ashes: ‘ We are that labour, and
our spawn after us.’ The Hajji said: ‘What is also my
name?’ They said: ‘Thy name is also The Merciful’
The Hajji said: ‘Praise then my mercy’; and while they
did this, the Hajji walked away, I following.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4625"><!--anchor1--></span>The Infant made some noise in his throat, and reached for more
Burgundy.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4628"><!--anchor1--></span>“About noon one of our six fell dead. Fright only frights
Sahib! None had—none could—touch him. Since they were
in pairs, and the other of the Fork was mad and sang foolishly, we
waited for some heathen to do what was needful. There came at last
Angari men with goats. The Hajji said: ‘What do ye see? They
said: ‘Oh, our Lord, we neither see nor hear.’ The
Hajji said: ‘But I command ye to see and to hear and to
say.’ They said: ‘Oh, our Lord, it is to our commanded
eyes as though slaves stood in a Fork.’ The Hajji said:
‘So testify before the officer who waits you in the town of
Dupe.’ They said: ‘What shall come to us after?’
The Hajji said: ‘The just reward for the informer. But if ye
do not testify, then a punishment which shall cause birds, to fall
from the trees in terror and monkeys to scream for pity.’
Hearing this, the Angari men hastened to Dupe. The Hajji then said
to me: ‘Are those things sufficient to establish our case, or
must I drive in a village full?’ I said that three witnesses
amply established any case, but as yet, I said, the Hajji had not
offered his slaves for sale. It is true, as our Sahib said just
now, there is one fine for catching slaves, and yet another for
making to sell them. And it was the double fine that we needed,
Sahib, for our Sahib’s cotton-play. We had fore-arranged all
this with Bulaki Ram, who knows the English Law, and, I thought the
Hajji remembered, but he grew angry, and cried out: ‘O God,
Refuge of the Afflicted, must I, who am what I am, peddle
this’ dog’s meat by the roadside to gain his delight
for my heart’s delight?” None the less, he admitted it
was the English Law, and so he offered me the
six—five—in a small voice, with an averted head. The
Sheshaheli do not smell of sour milk as heathen should. They smell
like leopards, Sahib. This is because they eat men.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4631"><!--anchor1--></span>“Maybe,” said Strickland. “But where were thy
wits? One witness is not sufficient to establish the fact of a
sale.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4634"><!--anchor1--></span>“What could we do, Sahib? There was the Hajji’s
reputation to consider. We could not have called in a heathen
witness for such a thing. And, moreover, the Sahib forgets that the
defendant himself was making this case. He would not contest his
own evidence. Otherwise, I know the law of evidence well
enough.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4638"><!--anchor1--></span>“So then we went to Dupe, and while Bulaki Ram waited
among the Angari men, ‘I ran to see our Sahib in bed. His
eyes were very bright, and his mouth was full of upside-down
orders, but the old woman had not loosened her hair for death. The
Hajji said: ‘Be quick with my trial. I am not Job!’ The
Hajji was a learned man. We made the trial swiftly to a sound of
soothing voices round the bed. Yet—yet, because no man can be
sure whether a Sahib of that blood sees, or does not see, we made
it strictly in the manner of the forms of the English Law. Only the
witnesses and the slaves and the prisoner we kept without for his
nose’s sake.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4641"><!--anchor1--></span>“Then he did not see the prisoner?” said
Strickland.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4644"><!--anchor1--></span>“I stood by to shackle up an Angari in case he should
demand it, but by God’s favour he was too far fevered to ask
for one. It is quite true he signed the papers. It is quite true he
saw the money put away in the safe—two hundred and ten
English pounds and it is quite true that the gold wrought on him as
a strong cure. But as to his seeing the prisoner, and having speech
with the man-eaters—the Hajji breathed all that on his
forehead to sink into his sick brain. A little, as ye have heard,
has remained . . . . Ah, but when the fever broke, and our Sahib
called for the fine-book, and the thin little picture-books from
Europe with the pictures of ploughs and hoes, and cotton
mills—ah, then he laughed as he used to laugh, Sahib. It was
his heart’s desire, this cotton-play. The Hajji loved him, as
who does not? It was a little, little arrangement, Sahib, of
which—is it necessary to tell all the world?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4647"><!--anchor1--></span>“And when didst thou know who the Hajji was?” said
Strickland.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4650"><!--anchor1--></span>“Not for a certainty till he and our Sahib had returned
from their visit to the Sheshaheli country. It is quite true as our
Sahib says, the man-eaters lay, flat around his feet, and asked for
spades to cultivate cotton. That very night, when I was cooking the
dinner, the Hajji said to me: ‘I go to my own place, though
God knows whether the Man with the Stone Eyes have left me an ox, a
slave, or a woman.’ I said: ‘Thou art then That
One?’ The Hajji said: ‘I am ten thousand rupees reward
into thy hand. Shall we make another law-case and get more cotton
machines for the boy?’ I said: ‘What dog am I to do
this? May God prolong thy life a thousand years!’ The Hajji
said: ‘Who has seen to-morrow? God has given me as it were a
son in my old age, and I praise Him. See that the breed is not
lost!’</p>
<p><span id="d23e4653"><!--anchor1--></span>“He walked then from the cooking-place to our
Sahib’s office-table under the tree, where our Sahib held in
his hand a blue envelope of Service newly come in by runner from
the North. At this, fearing evil news for the Hajji, I would have
restrained him, but he said: ‘We be both Great Ones. Neither
of us will fail.’ Our Sahib looked up to invite the Hajji to
approach before he opened the letter, but the Hajji stood off till
our Sahib had well opened and well read the letter. Then the Hajji
said: ‘Is it permitted to say farewell?’ Our Sahib
stabbed the letter on the file with a deep and joyful breath and
cried a welcome. The Hajji said: ‘I go to my own
place,’ and he loosed from his neck a chained heart of
ambergris set in soft gold and held it forth. Our Sahib snatched it
swiftly in the closed fist, down turned, and said ‘If thy
name be written hereon, it is needless, for a name is already
engraved on my heart.’ The Hajji said: ‘And on mine
also is a name engraved; but there is no name on the amulet.’
The Hajji stooped to our Sahib’s feet, but our Sahib raised
and embraced him, and the Hajji covered his mouth with his
shoulder-cloth, because it worked, and so he went away.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4657"><!--anchor1--></span>“And what order was in the Service letter?” Stalky
murmured.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4660"><!--anchor1--></span>“Only an order for our Sahib to write a report on some new
cattle sickness. But all orders come in the same make of envelope.
We could not tell what order it might have been.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4663"><!--anchor1--></span>“When he opened the letter—my son—made he no
sign? A cough? An oath?” Strickland asked.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4666"><!--anchor1--></span>“None, Sahib. I watched his hands. They did not shake.
Afterward he wiped his face, but he was sweating before from the
heat.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4669"><!--anchor1--></span>“Did he know? Did he know who the Hajji was?” said
the Infant in English.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4672"><!--anchor1--></span>“I am a poor man. Who can say what a Sahib of that get
knows or does not know? But the Hajji is right. The breed should
not be lost. It is not very hot for little children in Dupe, and as
regards nurses, my sister’s cousin at Jull—”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4676"><!--anchor1--></span>“H’m! That is the boy’s own concern. I wonder
if his Chief ever knew?” said Strickland.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4679"><!--anchor1--></span>“Assuredly,” said Imam Din. “On the night
before our Sahib went down to the sea, the Great Sahib—the
Man with the Stone Eyes—dined with him in his camp, I being
in charge of the table. They talked a long while and the Great
Sahib said: ‘What didst thou think of That One?’ (We do
not say Ibn Makarrah yonder.) Our Sahib said: ‘Which
one?’ The Great Sahib said: ‘That One which taught thy
man-eaters to grow cotton for thee. He was in thy District three
months to my certain knowledge, and I looked by every runner that
thou wouldst send me in his head.’ Our Sahib said: ‘If
his head had been needed, another man should have been appointed to
govern my District, for he was my friend.’ The Great Sahib
laughed and said: ‘If I had needed a lesser man in thy place
be sure I would have sent him, as, if I had needed the head of That
One, be sure I would have sent men to bring it to me. But tell me
now, by what means didst thou twist him to thy use and our profit
in this cotton-play?’ Our Sahib said: ‘By God, I did
not use that man in any fashion whatever. He was my friend.’
The Great Sahib said: ‘ ’<strong>Toh Vac</strong>! (Bosh!)
Tell!’ Our Sahib shook his head as he does—as he did
when a child—and they looked at each other like sword-play
men in the ring at a fair. The Great Sahib dropped his eyes first
and he said: ‘So be it. I should perhaps have answered thus
in my youth. No matter. I have made treaty with That One as an ally
of the State. Some day he shall tell me the tale.’ Then I
brought in fresh coffee, and they ceased. But I do not think That
One will tell the Great Sahib more than our Sahib told
him.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4685"><!--anchor1--></span>“Wherefore?” I asked.</p>
<p><span id="d23e4688"><!--anchor1--></span>“Because they are both Great Ones, and I have observed in
my life that Great Ones employ words very little between each other
in their dealings; still less when they speak to a third concerning
those dealings. Also they profit by silence . . . . Now I think
that the mother has come down from the room, and I will go rub his
feet till he sleeps.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e4691"><!--anchor1--></span>His ears had caught Agnes’s step at the stair-head and
presently she passed us on her way to the music room humming the
<strong>Magnificat</strong>.</p>
