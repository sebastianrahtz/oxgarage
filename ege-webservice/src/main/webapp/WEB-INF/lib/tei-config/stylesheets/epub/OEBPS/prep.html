               <!--anchor1--></span>Easter term was but a month old when Stettson major, a dayboy,
            contracted diphtheria, and the Head was very angry. He decreed a new
            and narrower set of bounds—the infection had been traced to an
            out-lying farmhouse—urged the prefects severely to lick all
            trespassers, and promised extra attentions from his own hand.  There
            were no words bad enough for Stettson major, quarantined at his
            mother's house, who had lowered the school-average of health. This
            he  said in the gymnasium after prayers. Then he wrote some two
            hundred letters to as many anxious parents and guardians, and bade
            the school carry on. The trouble did not spread, but, one night, a
            dog-cart drove to the Head's door, and in the morning the Head had
            gone, leaving all things in charge of Mr. King, senior house-master.
            The Head often ran up to town, where the school devoutly believed he
            bribed officials for early proofs of the Army Examination papers; but
            this absence was unusually prolonged.

            They pushed through a dripping hedge, landed among water-logged clods,
            and sat down on a rust-coated harrow. The cheroot burned with
            sputterings of saltpetre. They smoked it gingerly, each passing to
            the other between dosed forefinger and thumb.

            through set teeth.  To prove his words he immediately laid all before
            them, and they followed his example...

         <p><span id="d26e9502">
               <!--anchor1--></span>But Beetle was in no case to answer. Limp and empty, they sprawled
            across the harrow, the rust marking their ulsters in red squares and
            the abandoned cheroot-end reeking under their very cold noses.
            Then—they had heard nothing—the Head himself stood before them—the
            Head who should have been in town bribing examiners—the Head
            fantastically attired in old tweeds and a deer-stalker!

               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Ah,’ he said, fingering his mustache. ‘Very good. I might have
            guessed who it was.  You will go back to the College and give my
            compliments to Mr. King and ask him to give you an extra-special
            licking. You will then do me five hundred lines. I shall be back
            to-morrow. Five hundred lines by five o'clock to-morrow. You are also
            gated for a week. This is not exactly the time for breaking bounds.
            Extra-special, please.’

         <p><span id="d26e9514">
               <!--anchor1--></span>He disappeared over the hedge as lightly as he had come. There was a
            murmur of women's voices in the deep lane.

         <p><span id="d26e9518">
               <!--anchor1--></span>‘Oh, you Prooshan brute!’ said McTurk as the voices died away.

         <p><span id="d26e9536">
               <!--anchor1--></span>Stalky made no answer—not even a soft one. They went to College and
            received that for which they had been sent. King enjoyed himself most
            thoroughly, for by virtue of their seniority the boys were exempt
            from his hand, save under special order.  Luckily, he was no expert
            in the gentle art.

            irreverently, quoting from some Shakespeare play that they were
            cramming that term. They regained their study and settled down to the
            imposition.

               <!--anchor1--></span>‘You're quite right, Beetle.’ Stalky spoke in silky and propitiating
            tones. ‘Now, if the Head had sent us up to a prefect, we'd have got
            something to remember!’

            about this business, because it's too bad for a row; but we want you

            viceroyalty. Mr. King had been talking at and round and over the
            boys' heads, in a lofty and promiscuous style, of public-school
            spirit and the traditions of ancient seats; for he always improved an
            occasion. Beyond waking in two hundred and fifty young hearts a lively
            hatred of all other foundations, he accomplished little—so little,
            indeed, that when, two days after the Head's return, he chanced to
            come across Stalky &amp; Co., gated but ever resourceful, playing marbles
            in the corridor, he said that he was not surprised—not in the least
            surprised. This was what he had expected from persons of their

            enormous side, were greeted with a cheerful ‘Hullo! What's the Shop

            form-rooms sniffing the well-remembered smells of ink and whitewash;
            they would find nephews and cousins in the lower forms and present

            that the Prooshan Bates was ‘a downy bird.’ Young blood who had
            stumbled into an entanglement with a pastry-cook's daughter at

            Indian regiment—arrived from Exeter on the morning of the match, he
            was cheered along the whole front of the College, for the prefects
            had repeated the sense of that which the Head had read them in
            Flint's study. When Prout's house understood that he would claim his
            Old Boy's right to a bed for one night, Beetle ran into King's house
            next door and executed a public ‘gloat’ up and down the enemy's big

            the scrimmage stood the school, crying, ‘Put down your heads and
            shove!’ Toward the end everybody lost all sense of decency, and
            mothers of day-boys too close to the touch-line heard language not
            included in the bills. No one was actually carried off the field, but
            both sides felt happier when time was called, and Beetle helped
            Stalky and McTurk into their overcoats. The two had met in the
            many-legged heart of things, and, as Stalky said, had ‘done each
            other proud.’ As they swaggered woodenly behind the teams—
            substitutes do not rank as equals of hairy men—they passed a
            pony-carriage near the wall, and a husky voice cried, ‘Well played.
            Oh, played indeed!’ It was Stettson major, white-checked and
            hollow-eyed, who had fought his way to the ground under escort of an

            got to the fort, and cut up the escort. Duncan was wounded, and the
            escort hooked it. There weren't more than twenty Sepoys all told, and
            there were any amount of Afridis. As things turned out, I was in
            charge at Fort Pearson. Fact was, I'd heard the firing and was just
            going to see about it, when Duncan's men came up. So we all turned
            back together. They told me something about an officer, but I
            couldn't get the hang of things till I saw a chap under the wheels of
            the cart out in the open, propped up on one arm, blazing away with a
            revolver. You see, the escort had abandoned the cart, and the
            Afridis—they're an awfully suspicious gang —thought the retreat was
            a trap—sort of draw, you know—and the cart was the bait. So they
            had left poor old Duncan alone. 'Minute they spotted how few we were,
            it was a race across the flat who should reach old Duncan first. We
            ran, and they ran, and we won, and after a little hackin' about they
            pulled off. I never knew it was one of us till I was right on top of
            him. There are heaps of Duncans in the service, and of course the name
            didn't remind me. He wasn't changed at all hardly. He'd been shot
            through the lungs, poor old man, and he was pretty thirsty. I gave
            him a drink and sat down beside him, and—funny thing, too—he said,
            'Hullo, Toffee!' and I said, 'Hullo, Fat-Sow! hope you aren't hurt,'
            or something of the kind. But he died in a minute or two—never
            lifted his head off my knees... I say, you chaps out there will get

            unimportant examinations, began with wrath and war. Mr. King had
            discovered that nearly all his house—it lay, as you know, next door
            but one to Prout's in the long range of buildings—had unlocked the
            doors between the dormitories and had gone in to listen to a story
            told by Crandall. He went to the Head, clamorous, injured, appealing;
            for he never approved of allowing so-called young men of tile world
            to contaminate the morals of boyhood. Very good, said the Head, he
            would attend to it.

            that make trouble; it's the masters. However, Prout and King don't
            approve of dormitory gatherings on this scale, and one must back up
            the house-masters. Moreover, it's hopeless to punish two houses only,
            so late in the term. We must be fair and include everybody. Let's
            see. They have a holiday task for the Easters, which, of course, none
            of them will ever look at. We will give the whole school, except
            prefects and study-boys, regular prep. to-night; and the Common-room
            will have to supply a master to take it. We must be fair to all.’

               <!--anchor1--></span>The school, frolicking among packed trunks, whooping down the
            corridor, and ‘gloating’ in form-rooms, received the news with
            amazement and rage. No school in the world did prep. on the last
            night of the term. This thing was monstrous, tyrannical, subversive
            of law, religion, and morality. They would go into the form-rooms,
            and they would take their degraded holiday task with them, but—here
            they smiled and speculated what manner of man the Common-room would
            send up against them. The lot fell on Mason, credulous and
            enthusiastic, who loved youth. No other master was anxious to take
            that ‘prep.,’ for the school lacked the steadying influence of
            tradition; and men accustomed to the ordered routine of ancient
            foundations found it occasionally insubordinate. The four long
            form-rooms, in which all below the rank of study-boys worked,
            received him with thunders of applause. Ere he had coughed twice they
            favored him with a metrical summary of the marriage laws of Great
            Britain, as recorded by the High Priest of the Israelites and
            commented on by the leader of the host. The lower forms reminded him
            that it was the last day, and that therefore he must ‘take it all in
            play.’ When he dashed off to rebuke them, the Lower Fourth and Upper
            Third began with one accord to be sick, loudly and realistically. Mr.
            Mason tried, of all vain things under heaven, to argue with them, and
            a bold soul at a back desk bade him ‘take fifty lines for not 'olding
            up 'is 'and before speaking.’ As one who prided himself upon the
            perfection of his English this cut Mason to the quick, and while he
            was trying to discover the offender, the Upper and Lower Second,
            three form-rooms away, turned out the gas and threw ink-pots. It was
            a pleasant and stimulating ‘prep.’ The study-boys and prefects heard
            the echoes of it far off, and the Common-room at dessert smiled.

            soon as they saw they were understood, waiting for no comment; while
            the noise of that unholy ‘prep.’ grew and deepened. By the door of
            Flint's study they met Mason flying towards the corridor.—‘He's
            gone to fetch the Head. Hurry up! Come on!’ They broke into Number
            Twelve form-room abreast and panting.

            he was in town. Stop rotting, you asses!  Stettson major would have

            him, the Head entered. It was in the established order of things that
            no boy should speak or move under his eye. He expected the hush of
            awe. He was received with cheers—steady, ceaseless cheering.  Being
            a wise man, he went away, and the forms were silent and a little
            frightened.

            mornin'. We got the cream of it,’ said Stalky. ‘Now wait till a few
            chaps come out, and we'll really cheer him.’

            but when it spread to the gymnasium, when the boys awaiting their
            turn cheered, the Head gave it up in despair, and the remnant flung
            themselves upon him to shake hands. Then they seriously devoted
            themselves to cheering till the brakes were hustled off the premises
            in dumb-show.

            they swung into the narrow Northam street. ‘Now all together—takin'
            time from your Uncle Stalky:
            ‘It's a way we have in the Army,
            It's a way we have in the Navy,
            It's a way we have at the Public Schools,
            Which nobody can deny!’
