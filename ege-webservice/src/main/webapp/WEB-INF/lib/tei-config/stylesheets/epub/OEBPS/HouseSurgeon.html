            evening after Easter Day, I sat at a table in a homeward bound
            steamer’s smoking-room, where half a dozen of us told ghost
            stories. As our party broke up a man, playing Patience in the next
            alcove, said to me: “I didn’t quite catch the end of
            that last story about the Curse on the family’s
            first-born.”

               <!--anchor1--></span>“It turned out to be drains,” I explained. “As
            soon as new ones were put into the house the Curse was lifted, I
            believe. I never knew the people myself.”

         <p><span id="d26e6411">

               <!--anchor1--></span>“Sit down again, and have one with me,” said the
            Patience player. “No, it isn’t a ghost. Our trouble is
            more depression than anything else.”

               <!--anchor1--></span>“It’s—it’s nothing worse than a little
            depression. And the odd part is that there hasn’t been a
            death in the house since it was built—in 1863. The lawyer
            said so. That decided me—my good lady, rather and he made me
            pay an extra thousand for it.”

               <!--anchor1--></span>“Yes; ain’t it? It was built for three
            sisters—Moultrie was the name—three old maids. They all
            lived together; the eldest owned it. I bought it from her lawyer a
            few years ago, and if I’ve spent a pound on the place first
            and last, I must have spent five thousand. Electric light, new
            servants’ wing, garden—all that sort of thing. A man
            and his family ought to be happy after so much expense, ain’t
            it?” He looked at me through the bottom of his glass.

            depression; but it’s hard on my little girl. I say little;
            but she’s twenty. We send her visiting to escape it. She
            almost lived at hotels and hydros, last year, but that isn’t
            pleasant for her. She used to be a canary—a perfect
            canary—always singing. You ought to hear her. She
            doesn’t sing now. That sort of thing’s unwholesome for
            the young, ain’t it?”

            ’twouldn’t touch your good self at all. You might
            be—immune, ain’t it? On the other hand, if this
            influenza,—influence <em>does</em> happen to affect you, why, I think
            it will be an experience.”

               <!--anchor1--></span>While he talked he gave me his card, and I read his name was L.

            afternoon anywhere in London you choose to name, and I’ll be
            only too happy to motor you down. It ought to be a delightful run
            at this time of year the rhododendrons will be out. I mean it. You
            don’t know how truly I mean it. Very probably—it
            won’t affect you at all. And—I think I may say I have
            the finest collection of narwhal tusks in the world. All the best
            skins and horns have to go through London, and L. Maxwell
            M’Leod, he knows where they come from, and where they go to.

         <p><span id="d26e6487">
               <!--anchor1--></span>For the rest of the voyage up-channel Mr. M’Leod talked to
            me of the assembling, preparation, and sale of the rarer furs; and
            told me things about the manufacture of fur-lined coats which quite
            shocked me. Somehow or other, when we landed on Wednesday, I found
            myself pledged to spend that week-end with him at Holmescroft.

         <p><span id="d26e6490">
               <!--anchor1--></span>On Saturday he met me with a well-groomed motor, and ran me out,
            in an hour and a half, to an exclusive residential district of
            dustless roads and elegantly designed country villas, each standing
            in from three to five acres of perfectly appointed land. He told me
            land was selling at eight hundred pounds the acre, and the new golf
            links, whose Queen Anne pavilion we passed, had cost nearly
            twenty-four thousand pounds to create.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e6493">
               <!--anchor1--></span>Holmescroft was a large, two-storied, low, creeper-covered
            residence. A verandah at the south side gave on to a garden and two
            tennis courts, separated by a tasteful iron fence from a most
            park-like meadow of five or six acres, where two Jersey cows
            grazed. Tea was ready in the shade of a promising copper beech, and
            I could see groups on the lawn of young men and maidens
            appropriately clothed, playing lawn tennis in the sunshine.

         <p><span id="d26e6496">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“A pretty scene, ain’t it?” said Mr.
            M’Leod. “My good lady’s sitting under the tree,
            and that’s my little girl in pink on the far court. But
            I’ll take you to your room, and you can see ’em all
            later.”

         <p><span id="d26e6500">
               <!--anchor1--></span>He led me through a wide parquet-floored hall furnished in pale
            lemon, with huge Cloisonnee vases, an ebonized and gold grand
            piano, and banks of pot flowers in Benares brass bowls, up a pale
            oak staircase to a spacious landing, where there was a green velvet
            settee trimmed with silver. The blinds were down, and the light lay
            in parallel lines on the floors.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e6503">
               <!--anchor1--></span>He showed me my room, saying cheerfully: “You may be a
            little tired. One often is without knowing it after a run through
            traffic. Don’t come down till you feel quite restored. We
            shall all be in the garden.”
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e6506">
               <!--anchor1--></span>My room was rather warm, and smelt of perfumed soap. I threw up
            the window at once, but it opened so close to the floor and worked
            so clumsily that I came within an ace of pitching out, where I
            should certainly have ruined a rather lop-sided laburnum below. As
            I set about washing off the journey’s dust, I began to feel a
            little tired. But, I reflected, I had not come down here in this
            weather and among these new surroundings to be depressed; so I
            began to whistle.

         <p><span id="d26e6509">
               <!--anchor1--></span>And it was just then that I was aware of a little grey shadow,
            as it might have been a snowflake seen against the light, floating
            at an immense distance in the background of my brain. It annoyed
            me, and I shook my head to get rid of it. Then my brain telegraphed
            that it was the forerunner of a swift-striding gloom which there
            was yet time to escape if I would force my thoughts away from it,
            as a man leaping for life forces his body forward and away from the
            fall of a wall. But the gloom overtook me before I could take in
            the meaning of the message. I moved toward the bed, every nerve
            already aching with the foreknowledge of the pain that was to be
            dealt it, and sat down, while my amazed and angry soul dropped,
            gulf by gulf, into that horror of great darkness which is spoken of
            in the Bible, and which, as auctioneers say, must be experienced to
            be appreciated.

               <!--anchor1--></span>Despair upon despair, misery upon misery, fear after fear, each
            causing their distinct and separate woe, packed in upon me for an
            unrecorded length of time, until at last they blurred together, and
            I heard a click in my brain like the click in the ear when one
            descends in a diving bell, and I knew that the pressures were
            equalised within and without, and that, for the moment, the worst
            was at an end. But I knew also that at any moment the darkness
            might come down anew; and while, I dwelt on this speculation
            precisely as a man torments a raging tooth with his tongue, it
            ebbed away into the little grey shadow on the brain of its first
            coming, and once more I heard my brain, which knew what would
            recur, telegraph to every quarter fox help, release or
            diversion.

         <p><span id="d26e6515">
               <!--anchor1--></span>The door opened, and M’Leod reappeared. I thanked him
            politely, saying I was charmed with my room, anxious to meet Mrs.
            M’Leod, much refreshed with my wash, and so on and so forth.
            Beyond a little stickiness at the corners of my mouth, it seemed to
            me that I was managing my words admirably; the while that I myself
            cowered at the bottom of unclimbable pits. M’Leod laid his
            hand on my shoulder, and said “You’ve got it now

            gentlemen of those parts. Magnificently appointed landaus and
            covered motors swept in and out of the drive, and the air was gay

            who apparently knew everything about every South American railway

            broke, and Mr. Baxter took me to his links, quite ten miles off,
            where in a maze of tramway lines, railroads, and nursery-maids, we
            skelped our divotted way round nine holes like barges plunging
            through head seas. He played vilely and had never expected to meet
            any one worse; but as he realised my form, I think he began to like
            me, for he took me in hand by the two hours together. After a
            fortnight he could give me no more than a stroke a hole, and when,
            with this allowance, I once managed to beat him by one, he was
            honestly glad, and assured me that I should be a golfer if I stuck
            to it. I was sticking to it for my own ends, but now and again my
            conscience pricked me; for the man was a nice man. Between games he
            supplied me with odd pieces of evidence, such as that he had known
            the Moultries all his life, being their cousin, and that Miss Mary,
            the eldest, was an unforgiving woman who would never let bygones
            be. I naturally wondered what she might have against him; and
            somehow connected him unfavourably with mad Agnes.

            were striving against gag and bond to deliver its soul of an
            articulate word. It passed in a few minutes, and I fell to thinking
            about Mr. Baxter’s conscience and Agnes Moultrie, gone mad in
            the well-lit bedroom that waited me. These reflections secured me a
            night during which I rediscovered how, from purely mental causes, a
            man can be physically sick; but the sickness was bliss compared to
            my dreams when the birds waked. On my departure, M’Leod gave
            me a beautiful narwhal’s horn, much as a nurse gives a child

               <!--anchor1--></span>I went straight from that house to Burry Mills Hydro, keen for
            the first time in my life on playing golf, which is guaranteed to
            occupy the mind. Baxter had taken me a room communicating with his
            own, and after lunch introduced me to a tall, horse-headed elderly
            lady of decided manners, whom a white-haired maid pushed along in a
            bath-chair through the park-like grounds of the Hydro. She was Miss
            Mary Moultrie, and she coughed and cleared her throat just like
            Baxter. She suffered—she told me it was a Moultrie
            castemark—from some obscure form of chronic bronchitis,
            complicated with spasm of the glottis; and, in a dead, flat voice,
            with a sunken eye that looked and saw not, told me what washes,
            gargles, pastilles, and inhalations she had proved most beneficial.
            From her I was passed on to her younger sister, Miss Elizabeth, a
            small and withered thing with twitching lips, victim, she told me,
            to very much the same sort of throat, but secretly devoted to
            another set of medicines. When she went away with Baxter and the
            bath-chair, I fell across a major of the Indian army with gout in
            his glassy eyes, and a stomach which he had taken all round the
            Continent. He laid everything before me; and him I escaped only to
            be confided in by a matron with a tendency to follicular tonsilitis
            and eczema. Baxter waited hand and foot on his cousins till five
            o’clock, trying, as I saw, to atone for his treatment of the
            dead sister. Miss Mary ordered him about like a dog.

            between indraws of steam said: “The spasm came on just now,
            while I was asleep. I was nearly choking to death. So I went to the

            Bessie’s such an old maid about draughts. I tell you I was
            choking to death. I couldn’t manage the catch, and I nearly
            fell out. That window opens too low. I cut my hand trying to save
            myself. Who has tied it up in this filthy handkerchief? I wish you
            had had my throat, Bessie. I never was nearer dying!” She
            scowled on us all impartially, while her sister sobbed.

               <!--anchor1--></span>Then Baxter, seated by the side of the bed, began to
            cross-examine in a voice I scarcely recognised. No one could for an
            instant have doubted the genuine rage of Miss Mary against her
            sister, her cousin, or her maid; and that a doctor should have been
            called in for she did me the honour of calling me doctor—was
            the last drop. She was choking with her throat; had rushed to the
            window for air; had near pitched out, and in catching at the window
            bars had cut her hand. Over and over she made this clear to the
            intent Baxter. Then she turned on her sister and tongue-lashed her
            savagely.

            terrible woman went off to make arrangements. Then I sent a
            telegram to M’Leod bidding him and his vacate Holmescroft for
            that afternoon. Miss Mary should be alone with her dead, as I had
            been alone.

            justice, the promise given for the journey, she underwent it
            without murmur, spasm, or unnecessary word. Miss Bessie, pressed in
            a corner by the window, wept behind her veil, and from time to time
            tried to take hold of her sister’s hand. Baxter wrapped
            himself in his newly found happiness as selfishly as a bridegroom,
            for he sat still and smiled.

            racking experience of the day. M’Leod had obeyed my
            instructions. There was no one visible in the house or the gardens;
            and the front door stood open.

               <!--anchor1--></span>“Restful?” I began, but stopped of a sudden, for I
            felt all over my bruised soul that Baxter was speaking truth. It
            was a light, spacious, airy house, full of the sense of well-being
            and peace—above all things, of peace. I ventured into the
            dining-room where the thoughtful M’Leod’s had left a
            small fire. There was no terror there, present or lurking; and in
            the drawing-room, which for good reasons we had never cared to
            enter, the sun and the peace and the scent of the flowers worked
            together as is fit in an inhabited house. When I returned to the
            hall, Baxter was sweetly asleep on a couch, looking most unlike a
            middle-aged solicitor who had spent a broken night with an exacting
            cousin.

            myself upon my magnificent acumen (barring some errors about Baxter

            and Baxter, evidently a light sleeper, sprang awake.

            “What ideas these Jews have of arranging furniture!”
            She spied me behind a big Cloisonnee vase. “I’ve seen
            the window,” she said remotely. “You took a great risk

            still smiling and self-absorbed, and the cold disapproval of Miss
            Mary, who thought the pattern of the china vulgar. However, she ate
            well, and even asked me whether I would not like a cup of tea for
