<h1 class="head">The Motherhive</h1>
<p><span id="d23e2020"><!--anchor1--></span>IF THE
stock had not been old and overcrowded, the Wax-moth would never
have entered; but where bees are too thick on the comb there must
be sickness or parasites. The heat of the hive had risen with the
June honey-flow, and though the farmers worked, until their wings
ached, to keep people cool, everybody suffered.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2023"><!--anchor1--></span>A young bee crawled up the greasy trampled alighting-board.
“Excuse me,” she began, “but it’s my first
honey-flight. Could you kindly tell me if this is
my—”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2026"><!--anchor1--></span>“—own hive?” the Guard snapped. “Yes!
Buzz in, and be foul-brooded to you! Next!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2029"><!--anchor1--></span>“Shame!” cried half a dozen old workers with worn
wings and nerves, and there was a scuffle and a hum.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2033"><!--anchor1--></span>The little grey Wax-moth, pressed close in a crack in the
alighting-board, had waited this chance all day. She scuttled in
like a ghost, and, knowing the senior bees would turn her out at
once, dodged into a brood-frame, where youngsters who had not yet
seen the winds blow or the flowers nod discussed life. Here she was
safe, for young bees will tolerate any sort of stranger. Behind her
came the bee who had been slanged by the Guard.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2036"><!--anchor1--></span>“What is the world like, Melissa?” said a companion.
“Cruel! I brought in a full load of first-class stuff, and
the Guard told me to go and be foul-brooded!” She sat down in
the cool draught across the combs.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2039"><!--anchor1--></span>“If you’d only heard,” said the Wax-moth
silkily, “the insolence of the Guard’s tone when she
cursed our sister. It aroused the Entire Community.” She laid
an egg. She had stolen in for that purpose.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2042"><!--anchor1--></span>“There was a bit of a fuss on the Gate,” Melissa
chuckled. “You were there, Miss?” She did not know how
to address the slim stranger.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2045"><!--anchor1--></span>“Don’t call me ‘Miss.’ I’m a
sister to all in affliction—just a working-sister. My heart
bled for you beneath your burden.” The Wax-moth caressed
Melissa with her soft feelers and laid another egg.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2048"><!--anchor1--></span>“You mustn’t lay here,” cried Melissa.
“You aren’t a Queen.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2052"><!--anchor1--></span>“My dear child, I give you my most solemn word of honour
those aren’t eggs. Those are my principles, and I am ready to
die for them.” She raised her voice a little above the rustle
and tramp round her. “If you’d like to kill me, pray
do.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2055"><!--anchor1--></span>“Don’t be unkind, Melissa,” said a young bee,
impressed by the chaste folds of the Wax-moth’s wing, which
hid her ceaseless egg-dropping.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2058"><!--anchor1--></span>“I haven’t done anything,” Melissa answered.
“She’s doing it all.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2061"><!--anchor1--></span>“Ah, don’t let your conscience reproach you later,
but when you’ve killed me, write me, at least, as one that
loved her fellow-worker.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2064"><!--anchor1--></span>Laying at every sob, the Wax-moth backed into a crowd of young
bees, and left Melissa bewildered and annoyed. So she lifted up her
little voice in the darkness and cried, “Stores!” till
a gang of cell-fillers hailed her, and she left her load with
them.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2067"><!--anchor1--></span>“I’m afraid I foul-brooded you just now,” said
a voice over her shoulder. “I’d been on the Gate for
three hours, and one would foul-brood the Queen herself after that.
No offence meant.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2071"><!--anchor1--></span>“None taken,” Melissa answered cheerily. “I
shall be on Guard myself, some day. What’s next to
do?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2074"><!--anchor1--></span>“There’s a rumour of Death’s Head Moths about.
Send a gang of youngsters to the Gate, and tell them to narrow it
in with a couple of stout scrap-wax pillars. It’ll make the
Hive hot, but we can’t have Death’s Headers in the
middle of our honey-flow.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2077"><!--anchor1--></span>“My Only Wings! I should think not!” Melissa had all
a sound bee’s hereditary hatred against the big, squeaking,
feathery Thief of the Hives. “Tumble out!” she called
across the youngsters’ quarters. “All you who
aren’t feeding babies, show a leg. Scrap-wax pillars for the
Ga-ate!” She chanted the order at length.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2080"><!--anchor1--></span>“That’s nonsense,” a downy, day-old bee
answered. “In the first place, I never heard of a
Death’s Header coming into a hive. People don’t do such
things. In the second, building pillars to keep ’em out is
purely a Cypriote trick, unworthy of British bees. In the third, if
you trust a Death’s Head, he will trust you. Pillar-building
shows lack of confidence. Our dear sister in grey says
so.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2083"><!--anchor1--></span>“Yes. Pillars are un-English and provocative, and a waste
of wax that is needed for higher and more practical ends,”
said the Wax-moth from an empty store-cell.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2086"><!--anchor1--></span>“The safety of the Hive is the highest thing I’ve
ever heard of. You mustn’t teach us to refuse work,”
Melissa began.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2090"><!--anchor1--></span>“You misunderstand me, as usual, love. Work’s the
essence of life; but to expend precious unreturning vitality and
real labour against imaginary danger, that is heartbreakingly
absurd! If I can only teach a—a little toleration—a
little ordinary kindness here toward that absurd old bogey you call
the Death’s Header, I shan’t have lived in
vain.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2093"><!--anchor1--></span>“She hasn’t lived in vain, the darling!” cried
twenty bees together. “You should see her saintly life,
Melissa! She just devotes herself to spreading her principles,
and—and—she looks lovely!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2096"><!--anchor1--></span>An old, baldish bee came up the comb.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2099"><!--anchor1--></span>“Pillar-workers for the Gate! Get out and chew scraps.
Buzz off!” she said. The Wax-moth slipped aside.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2102"><!--anchor1--></span>The young bees trooped down the frame, whispering.
“What’s the matter with ’em?” said the
oldster. “Why do they call each other ‘ducky’ and
‘darling’? Must be the weather.” She sniffed
suspiciously. “Horrid stuffy smell here. Like stale quilts.
Not Wax-moth, I hope, Melissa?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2105"><!--anchor1--></span>“Not to my knowledge,” said Melissa, who, of course,
only knew the Wax-moth as a lady with principles, and had never
thought to report her presence. She had always imagined Wax-moths
to be like blood-red dragon-flies.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2109"><!--anchor1--></span>“You had better fan out this corner for a little,”
said the old bee and passed on. Melissa dropped her head at once,
took firm hold with her fore-feet, and fanned obediently at the
regulation stroke three hundred beats to the second. Fanning tries
a bee’s temper, because she must always keep in the same
place where she never seems to be doing any good, and, all the
while, she is wearing out her only wings. When a bee cannot fly, a
bee must not live; and a bee knows it. The Wax-moth crept forth,
and caressed Melissa again.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2112"><!--anchor1--></span>“I see,” she murmured, “that at heart you are
one of Us.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2115"><!--anchor1--></span>“I work with the Hive,” Melissa answered
briefly.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2118"><!--anchor1--></span>“It’s the same thing. We and the Hive are
one.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2121"><!--anchor1--></span>“Then why are your feelers different from ours?
Don’t cuddle so.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2124"><!--anchor1--></span>“Don’t be provincial, Carissima. You can’t
have all the world alike—yet.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2128"><!--anchor1--></span>“But why do you lay eggs?” Melissa insisted.
“You lay ’em like a Queen—only you drop them in
patches all over the place. I’ve watched you.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2131"><!--anchor1--></span>“Ah, Brighteyes, so you’ve pierced my little
subterfuge? Yes, they are eggs. By and by they’ll spread our
principles. Aren’t you glad?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2134"><!--anchor1--></span>“You gave me your most solemn word of honour that they
were not eggs.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2137"><!--anchor1--></span>“That was my little subterfuge, dearest—for the sake
of the Cause. Now I must reach the young.” The Wax-moth
tripped towards the fourth brood-frame where the young bees were
busy feeding the babies.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2140"><!--anchor1--></span>It takes some time for a sound bee to realize a malignant and
continuous lie. “She’s very sweet and feathery,”
was all that Melissa thought, “but her talk sounds like ivy
honey tastes. I’d better get to my field-work
again.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2143"><!--anchor1--></span>She found the Gate in a sulky uproar. The youngsters told off to
the pillars had refused to chew scrap-wax because it made their
jaws ache, and were clamouring for virgin stuff.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2147"><!--anchor1--></span>“Anything to finish the job!” said the badgered
Guards. “Hang up, some of you, and make wax for these
slack-jawed sisters.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2150"><!--anchor1--></span>Before a bee can make wax she must fill herself with honey. Then
she climbs to safe foothold and hangs, while other gorged bees hang
on to her in a cluster. There they wait in silence till the wax
comes. The scales are either taken out of the maker’s pockets
by the workers, or tinkle down on the workers while they wait. The
workers chew them (they are useless unchewed) into the
all-supporting, all-embracing Wax of the Hive.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2153"><!--anchor1--></span>But now, no sooner was the wax-cluster in position than the
workers below broke out again.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2156"><!--anchor1--></span>“Come down!” they cried. “Come down and work!
Come on, you Levantine parasites! Don’t think to enjoy
yourselves up there while we’re sweating down
here!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2159"><!--anchor1--></span>The cluster shivered, as from hooked fore-foot to hooked
hind-foot it telegraphed uneasiness. At last a worker sprang up,
grabbed the lowest waxmaker, and swung, kicking above her
companions.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2162"><!--anchor1--></span>“I can make wax too!” she bawled. “Give me a
full gorge and I’ll make tons of it.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2166"><!--anchor1--></span>“Make it, then,” said the bee she had grappled. The
spoken word snapped the current through the cluster. It shook and
glistened like a cat’s fur in the dark. “Unhook!”
it murmured. “No wax for any one to-day.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2169"><!--anchor1--></span>“You lazy thieves! Hang up at once and produce our
wax,” said the bees below.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2172"><!--anchor1--></span>“Impossible! The sweat’s gone. To make your wax we
must have stillness, warmth, and food. Unhook! Unhook!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2175"><!--anchor1--></span>They broke up as they murmured, and disappeared among the other
bees, from whom, of course, they were undistinguishable.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2178"><!--anchor1--></span>“Seems as if we’d have to chew scrap-wax for these
pillars, after all,” said a worker.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2181"><!--anchor1--></span>“Not by a whole comb,” cried the young bee who had
broken the cluster. “Listen here! I’ve studied the
question more than twenty minutes. It’s as simple as falling
off a daisy. You’ve heard of Cheshire, Root and
Langstroth?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2185"><!--anchor1--></span>They had not, but they shouted “Good old
Langstroth!” just the same.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2188"><!--anchor1--></span>“Those three know all that there is to be known about
making hives. One or t’other of ’em must have made
ours, and if they’ve made it, they’re bound to look
after it. Ours is a ‘Guaranteed Patent Hive.’ You can
see it on the label behind.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2191"><!--anchor1--></span>“Good old guarantee! Hurrah for the label behind!”
roared the bees.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2194"><!--anchor1--></span>“Well, such being the case, I say that when we find
they’ve betrayed us, we can exact from them a terrible
vengeance.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2197"><!--anchor1--></span>“Good old vengeance! Good old Root! ’Nuff said!
Chuck it!” The crowd cheered and broke away as Melissa dived
through.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2200"><!--anchor1--></span>“D’you know where Langstroth, Root and Cheshire,
live if you happen to want em?” she asked of the proud
panting orator.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2204"><!--anchor1--></span>“Gum me if I know they ever lived at all! But aren’t
they beautiful names to buzz about? Did you see how it worked up
the sisterhood?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2207"><!--anchor1--></span>“Yes; but it didn’t defend the Gate,” she
replied.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2210"><!--anchor1--></span>“Ah, perhaps that’s true, but think how delicate my
position is, sister. I’ve a magnificent appetite, and I
don’t like working. It’s bad for the mind. My instinct
tells me that I can act as a restraining influence on others. They
would have been worse, but for me.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2213"><!--anchor1--></span>But Melissa had already risen clear, and was heading for a
breadth of virgin white clover, which to an overtired bee is as
soothing as plain knitting to a woman.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2216"><!--anchor1--></span>“I think I’ll take this load to the
nurseries,” she said, when she had finished. “It was
always quiet there in my day,” and she topped off with two
little pats of pollen for the babies.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2219"><!--anchor1--></span>She was met on the fourth brood-comb by a rush of excited
sisters all buzzing together.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2223"><!--anchor1--></span>“One at a time! Let me put down my load. Now, what is it
Sacharissa?” she said.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2226"><!--anchor1--></span>“Grey Sister—that fluffy one, I mean—she came
and said we ought to be out in the sunshine gathering honey,
because life was short. She said any old bee could attend to our
babies, and some day old bees would. That isn’t true,
Melissa, is it? No old bees can take us away from our babies, can
they?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2229"><!--anchor1--></span>“Of course not. You feed the babies while your heads are
soft. When your heads harden, you go on to field-work. Any one
knows that.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2232"><!--anchor1--></span>“We told her so! We told her so; but she only waved her
feelers, and said we could all lay eggs like Queens if we chose.
And I’m afraid lots of the weaker sisters believe her, and
are trying to do it. So unsettling!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2235"><!--anchor1--></span>Sacharissa sped to a sealed worker-cell whose lid pulsated, as
the bee within began to cut its way out.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2238"><!--anchor1--></span>“Come along, precious!” she murmured, and thinned
the frail top from the other side. A pale, damp, creased thing
hoisted itself feebly on to the comb. Sacharissa’s note
changed at once. “No time to waste! Go up the frame and preen
yourself!” she said. “Report for nursing-duty in my
ward to-morrow evening at six. Stop a minute. What’s the
matter with your third right leg?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2242"><!--anchor1--></span>The young bee held it out in silence—unmistakably a drone
leg incapable of packing pollen.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2245"><!--anchor1--></span>“Thank you. You needn’t report till the day after
to-morrow.” Sacharissa turned to her companion.
“That’s the fifth oddity hatched in my ward since noon.
I don’t like it.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2248"><!--anchor1--></span>“There’s always a certain number of
’em,” said Melissa. “You can’t stop a few
working sisters from laying, now and then, when they overfeed
themselves. They only raise dwarf drones.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2251"><!--anchor1--></span>But we’re hatching out drones with workers’
stomachs; workers with drones’ stomachs; and albinoes and
mixed-leggers who can’t pack pollen—like that poor
little beast yonder. I don’t mind dwarf drones any more than
you do (they all die in July), but this steady hatch of oddities
frightens me, Melissa!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2254"><!--anchor1--></span>“How narrow of you! They are all so delightfully clever
and unusual and interesting,” piped the Wax-moth from a crack
above them. “Come here, you dear, downy duck, and tell us all
about your feelings.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2257"><!--anchor1--></span>“I wish she’d go!” Sacharissa lowered her
voice. “She meets these—er—oddities as they dry
out, and cuddles ’em in corners.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2261"><!--anchor1--></span>“I suppose the truth is that we’re over-stocked and
too well fed to swarm,” said Melissa.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2264"><!--anchor1--></span>“That is the truth,” said the Queen’s voice
behind them. They had not heard the heavy royal footfall which sets
empty cells vibrating. Sacharissa offered her food at once. She ate
and dragged her weary body forward. “Can you suggest a
remedy?” she said.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2267"><!--anchor1--></span>“New principles!” cried the Wax-moth from her
crevice. “We’ll apply them quietly later.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2270"><!--anchor1--></span>“Suppose we sent out a swarm?” Melissa suggested.
“It’s a little late, but it might ease us
off.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2273"><!--anchor1--></span>“It would save us, but—I know the Hive! You shall
see for yourself.” The old Queen cried the Swarming Cry,
which to a bee of good blood should be what the trumpet was to
Job’s war-horse. In spite of her immense age (three, years),
it rang between the canon-like frames as a pibroch rings in a
mountain pass; the fanners changed their note, and repeated it up
in every gallery; and the broad-winged drones, burly and eager,
ended it on one nerve-thrilling outbreak of bugles: “<strong>La
Reine le veult!</strong> Swarm! Swar-rm! Swar-r-rm!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2279"><!--anchor1--></span>But the roar which should follow the Call was wanting. They
heard a broken grumble like the murmur of a falling tide.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2283"><!--anchor1--></span>“Swarm? What for? Catch me leaving a good bar-frame Hive,
with fixed foundations, for a rotten, old oak out in the open where
it may rain any minute! We’re all right! It’s a
‘Patent Guaranteed Hive.’ Why do they want to turn us
out? Swarming be gummed! Swarming was invented to cheat a worker
out of her proper comforts. Come on off to bed!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2286"><!--anchor1--></span>The noise died out as the bees settled in empty cells for the
night.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2289"><!--anchor1--></span>“You hear?” said the Queen. “I know the
Hive!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2292"><!--anchor1--></span>“Quite between ourselves, I taught them that,” cried
the Wax-moth. “Wait till my principles develop, and
you’ll see the light from a new quarter.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2295"><!--anchor1--></span>“You speak truth for once,” the Queen said suddenly,
for she recognized the Wax-moth. “That Light will break into
the top of the Hive. A Hot Smoke will follow it, and your children
will not be able to hide in any crevice.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2298"><!--anchor1--></span>“Is it possible?” Melissa whispered.
“I—we have sometimes heard a legend like it.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2302"><!--anchor1--></span>“It is no legend,” the old Queen answered. “I
had it from my mother, and she had it from hers. After the Wax-moth
has grown strong, a Shadow will fall across the gate; a Voice will
speak from behind a Veil; there will be Light, and Hot Smoke, and
earthquakes, and those who live will see everything that they have
done, all together in one place, burned up in one great
fire.” The old Queen was trying to tell what she had been
told of the Bee Master’s dealings with an infected hive in
the apiary, two or three seasons ago; and, of course, from her
point of view the affair was as important as the Day of
Judgment.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2305"><!--anchor1--></span>“And then?” asked horrified Sacharissa.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2308"><!--anchor1--></span>“Then, I have heard that a little light will burn in a
great darkness, and perhaps the world will begin again. Myself, I
think not.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2311"><!--anchor1--></span>“Tut! Tut!” the Wax-moth cried. “You good, fat
people always prophesy ruin if things don’t go exactly your
way. But I grant you there will be changes.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2314"><!--anchor1--></span>There were. When her eggs hatched, the wax was riddled with
little tunnels, coated with the dirty clothes of the caterpillars.
Flannelly lines ran through the honey-stores, the pollen-larders,
the foundations, and, worst of all, through the babies in their
cradles, till the Sweeper Guards spent half their time tossing out
useless little corpses. The lines ended in a maze of sticky webbing
on the face of the comb. The caterpillars could not stop spinning
as they walked, and as they walked everywhere, they smarmed and
garmed everything. Even where it did not hamper the bees’
feet, the stale, sour smell of the stuff put them off their work;
though some of the bees who had taken to egg laying said it
encouraged them to be mothers and maintain a vital interest in
life.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2317"><!--anchor1--></span>When the caterpillars became moths, they made friends with the
ever-increasing Oddities—albinoes, mixed-leggers, single-eyed
composites, faceless drones, halfqueens and laying sisters; and the
ever-dwindling band of the old stock worked themselves bald and
fray-winged to feed their queer charges. Most of the Oddities would
not, and many, on account of their malformations, could not, go
through a day’s field-work; but the Wax-moths, who were
always busy on the brood-comb, found pleasant home occupations for
them. One albino, for instance, divided the number of pounds of
honey in stock by the number of bees in the Hive, and proved that
if every bee only gathered honey for seven and three quarter
minutes a day, she would have the rest of the time to herself, and
could accompany the drones on their mating flights. The drones were
not at all pleased.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2321"><!--anchor1--></span>Another, an eyeless drone with no feelers, said that all
brood-cells should be perfect circles, so as not to interfere with
the grub or the workers. He proved that the old six-sided cell was
solely due to the workers building against each other on opposite
sides of the wall, and that if there were no interference, there
would be no angles. Some bees tried the new plan for a while, and
found it cost eight times more wax than the old six sided
specification; and, as they never allowed a cluster to hang up and
make wax in peace, real wax was scarce. However, they eked out
their task with varnish stolen from new coffins at funerals, and it
made them rather sick. Then they took to cadging round
sugar-factories and breweries, because it was easiest to get their
material from those places, and the mixture of glucose and beer
naturally fermented in store and blew the store-cells out of shape,
besides smelling abominably. Some of the sound bees warned them
that ill-gotten gains never prosper, but the Oddities at once
surrounded them and balled them to death. That was a punishment
they were almost as fond of as they were of eating, and they
expected the sound bees to feed them. Curiously enough the age-old
instinct of loyalty and devotion towards the Hive made the sound
bees do this, though their reason told them they ought to slip away
and unite with some other healthy stock in the apiary.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2324"><!--anchor1--></span>“What, about seven and three-quarter minutes’ work
now?” said Melissa one day as she came in. “I’ve
been at it for five hours, and I’ve only half a
load.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2327"><!--anchor1--></span>“Oh, the Hive subsists on the Hival Honey which the Hive
produces,” said a blind Oddity squatting in a store-cell.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2330"><!--anchor1--></span>“But honey is gathered from flowers outside two miles away
sometimes,” cried Melissa.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2333"><!--anchor1--></span>“Pardon me,” said the blind thing, sucking hard.
“But this is the Hive, is it not?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2336"><!--anchor1--></span>“It was. Worse luck, it is.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2340"><!--anchor1--></span>“And the Hival Honey is here, is it not?” It opened
a fresh store-cell to prove it.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2343"><!--anchor1--></span>“Ye-es, but it won’t be long at this rate,”
said Melissa.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2346"><!--anchor1--></span>“The rates have nothing to do with it. This Hive produces
the Hival Honey. You people never seem to grasp the economic
simplicity that underlies all life.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2349"><!--anchor1--></span>“Oh, me!” said poor Melissa, “haven’t
you ever been beyond the Gate?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2352"><!--anchor1--></span>“Certainly not. A fool’s eyes are in the ends of the
earth. Mine are in my head.” It gorged till it bloated.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2355"><!--anchor1--></span>Melissa took refuge in her poorly paid field-work and told
Sacharissa the story.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2359"><!--anchor1--></span>“Hut!” said that wise bee, fretting with an old maid
of a thistle. “Tell us something new. The Hive’s full
of such as him—it, I mean.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2362"><!--anchor1--></span>“What’s the end to be? All the honey going out and
none coming in. Things can’t last this way!” said
Melissa.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2365"><!--anchor1--></span>“Who cares?” said Sacharissa. “I know now how
drones feel the day before they’re killed. A short life and a
merry one for me.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2368"><!--anchor1--></span>“If it only were merry! But think of those awful, solemn,
lop-sided Oddities waiting for us at home crawling and clambering
and preaching—and dirtying things in the dark.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2371"><!--anchor1--></span>“I don’t mind that so much as their silly songs,
after we’ve fed ’em, all about ‘work among the
merry, merry blossoms’,” said Sacharissa from the deeps
of a stale Canterbury bell.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2374"><!--anchor1--></span>“I do. How’s our Queen?” said Melissa.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2378"><!--anchor1--></span>“Cheerfully hopeless, as usual. But she lays an egg now
and then.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2381"><!--anchor1--></span>“Does she so?” Melissa backed out of the next bell
with a jerk. “Suppose now, we sound workers tried to raise a
Princess in some clean corner?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2384"><!--anchor1--></span>“You’d be put to it to find one. The Hive’s
all Wax-moth and muckings. But—well?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2387"><!--anchor1--></span>“A Princess might help us in the time of the Voice behind
the Veil that the Queen talks of. And anything is better than
working for Oddities that chirrup about work that they can’t
do, and waste what we bring home.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2390"><!--anchor1--></span>“Who cares?” said Sacharissa. “I’m with
you, for the fun of it. The Oddities would ball us to death, if
they knew. Come home, and we’ll begin.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2393"><!--anchor1--></span>There is no room to tell how the experienced Melissa found a
far-off frame so messed and mishandled by abandoned cell-building
experiments that, for very shame, the bees never went there. How in
that ruin she blocked out a Royal Cell of sound wax, but disguised
by rubbish till it looked like a kopje among deserted kopjes. How
she prevailed upon the hopeless Queen to make one last effort and
lay a worthy egg. How the Queen obeyed and died. How her spent
carcass was flung out on the rubbish heap, and how a multitude of
laying sisters went about dropping drone-eggs where they listed,
and said there was no more need of Queens. How, covered by this
confusion, Sacharissa educated certain young bees to educate
certain new-born bees in the almost lost art of making Royal Jelly.
How the nectar for it was won out of hours in the teeth of chill
winds. How the hidden egg hatched true—no drone, but Blood
Royal. How it was capped, and how desperately they worked to feed
and double-feed the now swarming Oddities, lest any break in the
food-supplies should set them to instituting inquiries, which, with
songs about work, was their favourite amusement. How in an
auspicious hour, on a moonless night, the Princess came forth a
Princess indeed, and how Melissa smuggled her into a dark empty
honey-magazine, to bide her time; and how the drones, knowing she
was there, went about singing the deep disreputable love-songs of
the old days—to the scandal of the laying sisters, who do not
think well of drones. These things are, written in the Book of
Queens, which is laid up in the hollow of the Great Ash
Ygdrasil.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2397"><!--anchor1--></span>After a few days the weather changed again and became glorious.
Even the Oddities would now join the crowd that hung out on the
alighting-board, and would sing of work among the merry, merry
blossoms till an untrained ear might have received it for the hum
of a working hive. Yet, in truth, their store-honey had been eaten
long ago. They lived from day to day on the efforts of the few
sound bees, while the Wax-moth fretted and consumed again their
already ruined wax. But the sound bees never mentioned these
matters. They knew, if they did, the Oddities would hold a meeting
and ball them to death.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2400"><!--anchor1--></span>“Now you see what we have done,” said the Wax-moths.
“We have created New Material, a New Convention, a New Type,
as we said we would.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2403"><!--anchor1--></span>“And new possibilities for us,” said the laying
sisters gratefully. “You have given us a new life’s
work, vital and paramount.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2406"><!--anchor1--></span>“More than that,” chanted the Oddities in the
sunshine; “you have created a new heaven and a new earth.
Heaven, cloudless and accessible” (it was a perfect August
evening) “and Earth teeming with the merry, merry blossoms,
waiting only our honest toil to turn them all to good.
The—er—Aster, and the Crocus, and
the—er—Ladies’ Smock in her season, the
Chrysanthemum after her kind, and the Guelder Rose bringing forth
abundantly withal.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2409"><!--anchor1--></span>“Oh, Holy Hymettus!” said Melissa, awestruck.
“I knew they didn’t know how honey was made, but
they’ve forgotten the Order of the Flowers! What will become
of them?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2412"><!--anchor1--></span>A Shadow fell across the alighting-board as the Bee Master and
his son came by. The Oddities crawled in and a Voice behind a Veil
said: “I’ve neglected the old Hive too long. Give me
the smoker.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2416"><!--anchor1--></span>Melissa heard and darted through the gate. “Come, oh
come!” she cried. “It is the destruction the Old Queen
foretold. Princess, come!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2419"><!--anchor1--></span>“Really, you are too archaic for words,” said an
Oddity in an alley-way. “A cloud, I admit, may have crossed
the sun; but why hysterics? Above all, why Princesses so late in
the day? Are you aware it’s the Hival Tea-time? Let’s
sing grace.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2422"><!--anchor1--></span>Melissa clawed past him with all six legs. Sacharissa had run to
what was left of the fertile brood-comb. “Down and
out!” she called across the brown breadth of it.
“Nurses, guards, fanners, sweepers—out! Never mind the
babies. They’re better dead.—Out, before the Light and
the Hot Smoke!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2425"><!--anchor1--></span>The Princess’s first clear fearless call (Melissa had
found her) rose and drummed through all the frames. “<strong>La
Reine le veult!</strong> Swarm! Swar-rm! Swar-r-rm!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2431"><!--anchor1--></span>The Hive shook beneath the shattering thunder of a stuck-down
quilt being torn back.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2434"><!--anchor1--></span>“Don’t be alarmed, dears,” said the Wax-moths.
“That’s our work. Look up, and you’ll see the
dawn of the New Day.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2438"><!--anchor1--></span>Light broke in the top of the hive as the Queen had,
prophesied—naked light on the boiling, bewildered bees.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2441"><!--anchor1--></span>Sacharissa rounded up her rearguard, which dropped headlong off
the frame, and joined the Princess’s detachment thrusting
toward the Gate. Now panic was in full blast, and each sound bee
found herself embraced by at least three Oddities. The first
instinct of a frightened bee is to break into the stores and gorge
herself with honey; but there were no stores left, so the Oddities
fought the sound bees.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2444"><!--anchor1--></span>“You must feed us, or we shall die!” they cried,
holding and clutching and slipping, while the silent scared earwigs
and little spiders twisted between their legs. “Think of the
Hive, traitors! The Holy Hive!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2447"><!--anchor1--></span>“You should have thought before!” cried the sound
bees., “Stay and see the dawn of your New Day.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2450"><!--anchor1--></span>They reached the Gate at last over the soft bodies of many to
whom they had ministered.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2453"><!--anchor1--></span>“On! Out! Up!” roared Melissa in the
Princess’s ear. “For the Hive’s sake! To the Old
Oak!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2457"><!--anchor1--></span>The Princess left the alighting-board, circled once, flung
herself at the lowest branch of the Old Oak, and her little loyal
swarm—you could have covered it with a pint
mug—followed, hooked, and hung.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2460"><!--anchor1--></span>“Hold close!” Melissa gasped. “The old legends
have come true! Look!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2463"><!--anchor1--></span>The Hive was half hidden by smoke, and Figures moved through the
smoke. They heard a frame crack stickily, saw it heaved high and
twirled round between enormous hands—a blotched, bulged, and
perished horror of grey wax, corrupt brood, and small drone-cells,
all covered with crawling Oddities, strange to the sun.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2466"><!--anchor1--></span>“Why, this isn’t a hive! This is a museum of
curiosities,” said the Voice behind the Veil. It was only the
Bee Master talking to his son.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2469"><!--anchor1--></span>“Can you blame ’em, father?” said a second
voice. “It’s rotten with Wax-moth. See here!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2472"><!--anchor1--></span>Another frame came up. A finger poked through it, and it broke
away in rustling flakes of ashy rottenness.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2476"><!--anchor1--></span>“Number Four Frame! That was your mother’s pet comb
once,” whispered Melissa to the Princess. “Many’s
the good egg I’ve watched her lay there.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2479"><!--anchor1--></span>“Aren’t you confusing <strong>post hoc</strong> with <strong>propter
hoc</strong>?” said the Bee Master. “Wax-moth only succeed
when weak bees let them in.” A third frame crackled and rose
into the light. “All this is full of laying workers’
brood. That never happens till the stock’s weakened.
Phew!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2488"><!--anchor1--></span>He beat it on his knee like a tambourine, and it also crumbled
to pieces.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2491"><!--anchor1--></span>The little swarm shivered as they watched the dwarf drone-grubs
squirm feebly on the grass. Many sound bees had nursed on that
frame, well knowing their work was useless; but the actual sight of
even useless work destroyed disheartens a good worker.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2494"><!--anchor1--></span>“No, they have some recuperative power left,” said
the second voice. “Here’s a Queen cell!”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2497"><!--anchor1--></span>“But it’s tucked away among—What on earth has
come to the little wretches? They seem to have lost the instinct of
cell-building.” The father held up the frame where the bees
had experimented in circular cell-work. It looked like the pitted
head, of a decaying toadstool.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2501"><!--anchor1--></span>“Not altogether,” the son corrected.
“There’s one line, at least, of perfectly good
cells.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2504"><!--anchor1--></span>“My work,” said Sacharissa to herself.
“I’m glad Man does me justice before—”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2507"><!--anchor1--></span>That frame, too, was smashed out and thrown atop of the others
and the foul earwiggy quilts.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2510"><!--anchor1--></span>As frame after frame followed it, the swarm beheld the upheaval,
exposure, and destruction of all that had been well or ill done in
every cranny of their Hive for generations past. There was black
comb so old that they had forgotten where it hung; orange, buff,
and ochre-varnished store-comb, built as bees were used to build
before the days of artificial foundations; and there was a little,
white, frail new work. There were sheets on sheets of level, even
brood-comb that had held in its time unnumbered thousands of
unnamed workers; patches of obsolete drone-comb, broad and
high-shouldered, showing to what marks the male grub was expected
to grow; and two-inch deep honey-magazines, empty, but still
magnificent, the whole gummed and glued into twisted scrap-work,
awry on the wires; half-cells, beginnings abandoned, or grandiose,
weak-walled, composite cells pieced out with rubbish and capped
with dirt.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2513"><!--anchor1--></span>Good or bad, every inch of it was so riddled by the tunnels of
the Wax-moth that it broke in clouds of dust as it was flung on the
heap.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2516"><!--anchor1--></span>“Oh, see!” cried Sacharissa. “The Great
Burning that Our Queen foretold. Who can bear to look?”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2520"><!--anchor1--></span>A flame crawled up the pile of rubbish, and they smelt singeing
wax.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2523"><!--anchor1--></span>The Figures stooped, lifted the Hive and shook it upside down
over the pyre. A cascade of Oddities, chips of broken comb, scale,
fluff, and grubs slid out, crackled, sizzled, popped a little, and
then the flames roared up and consumed all that fuel.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2526"><!--anchor1--></span>“We must disinfect,” said a Voice. “Get me a
sulphur-candle, please.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2529"><!--anchor1--></span>The shell of the Hive was returned to its place, a light was set
in its sticky emptiness, tier by tier the Figures built it up,
closed the entrance, and went away. The swarm watched the light
leaking through the cracks all the long night. At dawn one Wax-moth
came by, fluttering impudently.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2532"><!--anchor1--></span>“There has been a miscalculation about the New Day, my
dears,” she began; “one can’t expect people to be
perfect all at once. That was our mistake.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2535"><!--anchor1--></span>“No, the mistake was entirely ours,” said the
Princess.</p>
<p><span id="d23e2539"><!--anchor1--></span>“Pardon me,” said the Wax-moth. “When you
think of the enormous upheaval—call it good or
bad—which our influence brought about, you will admit that
we, and we alone—”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2542"><!--anchor1--></span>“You?” said the Princess. “Our stock was not
strong. So you came—as any other disease might have come.
Hang close, all my people.”</p>
<p><span id="d23e2545"><!--anchor1--></span>When the sun rose, Veiled Figures came down, and saw their swarm
at the bough’s end waiting patiently within sight of the old
Hive—a handful, but prepared to go on.</p>
