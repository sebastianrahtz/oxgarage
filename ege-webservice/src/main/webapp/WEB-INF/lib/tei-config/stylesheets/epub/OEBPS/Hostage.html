               <!--anchor1--></span>ONE night, a very long time ago, I drove to an Indian military
            cantonment called Mian Mir to see amateur theatricals. At the back
            of the Infantry barracks a soldier, his cap over one eye, rushed in
            front of the horses and shouted that he was a dangerous highway
            robber. As a matter of fact, he was a friend of mine, so I told him
            to go home before any one caught him; but he fell under the pole,
            and I heard voices of a military guard in search of some one.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1552">
               <!--anchor1--></span>The driver and I coaxed him into the carriage, drove home
            swiftly, undressed him and put him to bed, where he waked next
            morning with a sore headache, very much ashamed. When his uniform
            was cleaned and dried, and he had been shaved and washed and made
            neat, I drove him back to barracks with his arm in a fine white
            sling, and reported that I had accidentally run over him. I did not
            tell this story to my friend’s sergeant, who was a hostile
            and unbelieving person, but to his lieutenant, who did not know us
            quite so well.

         <p><span id="d26e1555">
               <!--anchor1--></span>Three days later my friend came to call, and at his heels
            slobbered and fawned one of the finest bull-terriers—of the
            old-fashioned breed, two parts bull and one terrier—that I
            had ever set eyes on. He was pure white, with a fawn-coloured
            saddle just behind his neck, and a fawn diamond at the root of his
            thin whippy tail. I had admired him distantly for more than a year;
            and Vixen, my own fox-terrier, knew him too, but did not
            approve.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1558">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“’E’s for you,” said my friend; but he
            did not look as though he liked parting with him.

         <p><span id="d26e1562">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“Nonsense! That dog’s worth more than most men,
            Stanley,” I said.

               <!--anchor1--></span>The dog rose on his hind legs, and stood upright for a full
            minute.

               <!--anchor1--></span>He sat on his haunches and turned his head sharp to the right.
            At a sign he rose and barked thrice. Then he shook hands with his
            right paw and bounded lightly to my shoulder. Here he made himself
            into a necktie, limp and lifeless, hanging down on either side of
            my neck. I was told to pick him up and throw him in the air. He
            fell with a howl, and held up one leg.

         <p><span id="d26e1577">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“Part o’ the trick,” said his owner.
            “You’re going to die now. Dig yourself your little
            grave an’ shut your little eye.”
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1581">
               <!--anchor1--></span>Still limping, the dog hobbled to the garden-edge, dug a hole
            and lay down in it. When told that he was cured, he jumped out,
            wagging his tail, and whining for applause. He was put through
            half-a-dozen other tricks, such as showing how he would hold a man
            safe (I was that man, and he sat down before me, his teeth bared,
            ready to spring), and how he would stop eating at the word of
            command. I had no more than finished praising him when my friend
            made a gesture that stopped the dog as though he had been shot,
            took a piece of blue-ruled canteen-paper from his helmet, handed it
            to me and ran away, while the dog looked after him and howled. I
            read:
            ‘<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Sir</span>—I give you the dog because of what you got me
            out of. He is the best I know, for I made him myself, and he is as
            good as a man. Please do not give him too much to eat, and please
            do not give him back to me, for I’m not going to take him, if
            you will keep him. So please do not try to give him back any more.
            I have kept his name back, so you can call him anything and he will
            answer. But please do not give him back. He can kill a man as easy
            as anything, but please do not give him too much meat. He knows
            more than a man.’
         </p>
         
         
         
         <p><span id="d26e1588">
               <!--anchor1--></span>Vixen sympathetically joined her shrill little yap to the
            bull-terrier’s despairing cry, and I was annoyed, for I knew
            that a man who cares for dogs is one thing, but a man who loves one
            dog is quite another. Dogs are at the best no more than verminous
            vagrants, self-scratchers, foul feeders, and unclean by the law of
            Moses and Mohammed; but a dog with whom one lives alone for at
            least six months in the year; a free thing, tied to you so strictly
            by love that without you he will not stir or exercise; a patient,
            temperate, humorous, wise soul, who knows your moods before you
            know them yourself, is not a dog under any ruling.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1591">
               <!--anchor1--></span>I had Vixen, who was all my dog to me; and I felt what my friend
            must have felt, at tearing out his heart in this style and leaving
            it in my garden. However, the dog understood clearly enough that I
            was his master, and did not follow the soldier. As soon as he drew
            breath I made much of him, and Vixen, yelling with jealousy, flew
            at him. Had she been of his own sex, he might have cheered himself
            with a fight, but he only looked worriedly when she nipped his deep
            iron sides, laid his heavy head on my knee, and howled anew. I
            meant to dine at the Club that night; but as darkness drew in, and
            the dog snuffed through the empty house like a child trying to
            recover from a fit of sobbing, I felt that I could not leave him to
            suffer his first evening alone. So we fed at home, Vixen on one
            side, and the stranger-dog on the other; she watching his every
            mouthful, and saying explicitly what she thought of his table
            manners, which were much better than hers.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1594">
               <!--anchor1--></span>It was Vixen’s custom, till the weather grew hot, to sleep
            in my bed, her head on the pillow like a Christian; and when
            morning came I would always find that the little thing had braced
            her feet against the wall and pushed me to the very edge of the
            cot. This night she hurried to bed purposefully, every hair up, one
            eye on the stranger, who had dropped on a mat in a helpless,
            hopeless sort of way, all four feet spread out, sighing heavily.
            She settled her head on the pillow several times, to show her
            little airs and graces, and struck up her usual whiney sing-song
            before slumber. The stranger-dog softly edged toward me. I put out
            my hand and he licked it. Instantly my wrist was between
            Vixen’s teeth, and her warning <strong>aaarh!</strong> said as plainly as
            speech, that if I took any further notice of the stranger she would
            bite.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1600">
               <!--anchor1--></span>I caught her behind her fat neck with my left hand, shook her
            severely, and said:
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1603">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“Vixen, if you do that again you’ll be put into the
            verandah. Now, remember!”
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1607">
               <!--anchor1--></span>She understood perfectly, but the minute I released her she
            mouthed my right wrist once more, and waited with her ears back and
            all her body flattened, ready to bite. The big dog’s tail
            thumped the floor in a humble and peace-making way.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1610">
               <!--anchor1--></span>I grabbed Vixen a second time, lifted her out of bed like a
            rabbit (she hated that and yelled), and, as I had promised, set her
            out in the verandah with the bats and the moonlight. At this she
            howled. Then she used coarse language—not to me, but to the
            bull-terrier—till she coughed with exhaustion. Then she ran
            round the house trying every door. Then she went off to the stables
            and barked as though some one were stealing the horses, which was
            an old trick of hers. Last she returned, and her snuffing yelp
            said, “I’ll be good! Let me in and I’ll’ be
            good!”
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1613">
               <!--anchor1--></span>She was admitted and flew to her pillow. When she was quieted I
            whispered to the other dog, “You can lie on the foot of the
            bed.” The bull jumped up at once, and though I felt Vixen
            quiver with rage, she knew better than to protest. So we slept till
            the morning, and they had early breakfast with me, bite for bite,
            till the horse came round and we went for a ride. I don’t
            think the bull had ever followed a horse before. He was wild with
            excitement, and Vixen, as usual, squealed and scuttered and
            scooted, and took charge of the procession.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1616">
               <!--anchor1--></span>There was one corner of a village near by, which we generally
            passed with caution, because all the yellow pariah-dogs of the
            place gathered about it.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1619">
               <!--anchor1--></span>They were half-wild, starving beasts, and though utter cowards,
            yet where nine or ten of them get together they will mob and kill
            and eat an English dog. I kept a whip with a long lash for
            them.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1622">
               <!--anchor1--></span>That morning they attacked Vixen, who, perhaps of design, had
            moved from beyond my horse’s shadow.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1626">
               <!--anchor1--></span>The bull was ploughing along in the dust, fifty yards behind,
            rolling in his run, and smiling as bull-terriers will. I heard
            Vixen squeal; half a dozen of the curs closed in on her; a white
            streak came up behind me; a cloud of dust rose near Vixen, and,
            when it cleared, I saw one tall pariah with his back broken, and
            the bull wrenching another to earth. Vixen retreated to the
            protection of my whip, and the bull paddled back smiling more than
            ever, covered with the blood of his enemies. That decided me to
            call him “Garm of the Bloody Breast,” who was a great
            person in his time, or “Garm” for short; so, leaning
            forward, I told him what his temporary name would be. He looked up
            while I repeated it, and then raced away. I shouted
            “Garm!” He stopped, raced back, and came up to ask my
            will.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1629">
               <!--anchor1--></span>Then I saw that my soldier friend was right, and that that dog
            knew and was worth more than a man. At the end of the ride I gave
            an order which Vixen knew and hated: “Go away and get
            washed!” I said. Garm understood some part of it, and Vixen
            interpreted the rest, and the two trotted off together soberly.
            When I went to the back verandah Vixen had been washed snowy-white,
            and was very proud of herself, but the dog-boy would not touch Garm
            on any account unless I stood by. So I waited while he was being
            scrubbed, and Garm, with the soap creaming on the top of his broad
            head, looked at me to make sure that this was what I expected him
            to endure. He knew perfectly that the dog-boy was only obeying
            orders.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1632">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“Another time,” I said to the dog-boy, “you
            will wash the great dog with Vixen when I send them
            home.”
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1635">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“Does <em>he</em> know?” said the dog-boy, who understood the
            ways of dogs.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1641">
               <!--anchor1--></span>“Garm,” I said, “another time you will be
            washed with Vixen.”
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1644">
               <!--anchor1--></span>I knew that Garm understood. Indeed, next washing-day, when
            Vixen as usual fled under my bed, Garm stared at the doubtful
            dog-boy in the verandah, stalked to the place where he had been
            washed last time, and stood rigid in the tub.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1648">
               <!--anchor1--></span>But the long days in my office tried him sorely. We three would
            drive off in the morning at half-past eight and come home at six or
            later. Vixen knowing the routine of it, went to sleep under my
            table; but the confinement ate into Garm’s soul. He generally
            sat on the verandah looking out on the Mall; and well I knew what
            he expected.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1651">
               <!--anchor1--></span>Sometimes a company of soldiers would move along on their way to
            the Fort, and Garm rolled forth to inspect them; or an officer in
            uniform entered into the office, and it was pitiful to see poor
            Garm’s welcome to the cloth—not the man. He would leap
            at him, and sniff and bark joyously, then run to the door and back
            again. One afternoon I heard him bay with a full throat—a
            thing I had never heard before—and he disappeared. When I
            drove into my garden at the end of the day a soldier in white
            uniform scrambled over the wall at the far end, and the Garm that
            met me was a joyous dog. This happened twice or thrice a week for a
            month.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1654">
               <!--anchor1--></span>I pretended not to notice, but Garm knew and Vixen knew. He
            would glide homewards from the office about four o’clock, as
            though he were only going to look at the scenery, and this he did
            so quietly that but for Vixen I should not have noticed him. The
            jealous little dog under the table would give a sniff and a snort,
            just loud enough to call my attention to the flight. Garm might go
            out forty times in the day and Vixen would never stir, but when he
            slunk off to see his true master in my garden she told me in her
            own tongue. That was the one sign she made to prove that Garm did
            not altogether belong to the family. They were the best of friends
            at all times, <em>but</em>, Vixen explained that I was never to forget Garm
            did not love me as she loved me.
         </p>
         
         <p><span id="d26e1660">
               <!--anchor1--></span>I never expected it. The dog was not my dog could never be my
            dog—and I knew he was as miserable as his master who tramped
            eight miles a day to see him. So it seemed to me that the sooner
            the two were reunited the better for all. One afternoon I sent
            Vixen home alone in the dog-cart (Garm had gone before), and rode
            over to cantonments to find another friend of mine, who was an
            Irish soldier and a great friend of the dog’s master.

            return the retriever if I had found him, and, if I had not, to
            offer huge rewards. The last train to camp left at half-past ten,
            and Stanley, stayed till ten talking to Garm. I argued and
            entreated, and even threatened to shoot the bull-terrier, but the
            little man was as firm as a rock, though I gave him a good dinner
            and talked to him most severely. Garm knew as well as I that this
            was the last time he could hope to see his man, and followed
            Stanley like a shadow. The retriever said nothing, but licked his
            lips after his meal and waddled off without so much as saying
            “Thank you” to the disgusted dog-boy.

            who moaned in his sleep all night. When we went to the office he
            found a place under the table close to Vixen, and dropped flat till
            it was time to go home. There was no more running out into the
            verandahs, no slinking away for stolen talks with Stanley. As the
            weather grew warmer the dogs were forbidden to run beside the cart,
            but sat at my side on the seat, Vixen with her head under the crook
            of my left elbow, and Garm hugging the left handrail.

               <!--anchor1--></span>Here Vixen was ever in great form. She had to attend to all the
            moving traffic, such as bullock-carts that blocked the way, and
            camels, and led ponies; as well as to keep up her dignity when she
            passed low friends running in the dust. She never yapped for
            yapping’s sake, but her shrill, high bark was known all along
            the Mall, and other men’s terriers ki-yied in reply, and
            bullock-drivers looked over their shoulders and gave us the road
            with a grin.

               <!--anchor1--></span>But Garm cared for none of these things. His big eyes were on
            the horizon and his terrible mouth was shut. There was another dog
            in the office who belonged to my chief. We called him “Bob
            the Librarian,” because he always imagined vain rats behind
            the bookshelves, and in hunting for them would drag out half the
            old newspaper-files. Bob was a well-meaning idiot, but Garm did not
            encourage him. He would slide his head round the door panting,
            “Rats! Come along Garm!” and Garm would shift one
            forepaw over the other, and curl himself round, leaving Bob to
            whine at a most uninterested back. The office was nearly as
            cheerful as a tomb in those days.

            one Sunday morning, and a very young and foolish artilleryman (his
            battery had just moved to that part of the world) tried to steal
            them both. Vixen, of course, knew better than to take food from
            soldiers, and, besides, she had just finished her breakfast. So she
            trotted back with a large piece of the mutton that they issue to
            our troops, laid it down on my verandah, and looked up to see what
            I thought. I asked her where Garm was, and she ran in front of the
            horse to show me the way.

            very stiffly on the edge of a culvert with a greasy handkerchief on
            his knees. Garm was in front of him, looking rather pleased. When
            the man moved leg or hand, Garm bared his teeth in silence. A
            broken string hung from his collar, and the other half of, it lay,
            all warm, in the artilleryman’s still hand. He explained to
            me, keeping his eyes straight in front of him, that he had met this
            dog (he called him awful names) walking alone, and was going to
            take him to the Fort to be killed for a masterless pariah.

         <p><span id="d26e1833">
               <!--anchor1--></span>I said that Garm did not seem to me much of a pariah, but that
            he had better take him to the Fort if he thought best. He said he
            did not care to do so. I told him to go to the Fort alone. He said
            he did not want to go at that hour, but would follow my advice as
            soon as I had called off the dog. I instructed Garm to take him to
            the Fort, and Garm marched him solemnly up to the gate, one mile
            and a half under a hot sun, and I told the quarter-guard what had
            happened; but the young artilleryman was more angry than was at all
            necessary when they began to laugh. Several regiments, he was told,
            had tried to steal Garm in their time.

               <!--anchor1--></span>That month the hot weather shut down in earnest, and the dogs
            slept in the bathroom on the cool wet bricks where the bath is
            placed. Every morning, as soon as the man filled my bath the two
            jumped in, and every morning the man filled the bath a second time.
            I said to him that he might as well fill a small tub specially for
            the dogs. “Nay,” said he smiling, “it is not
            their custom. They would not understand. Besides, the big bath
            gives them more space.”

         <p><span id="d26e1840">
               <!--anchor1--></span>The punkah-coolies who pull the punkahs day and night came to
            know Garm intimately. He noticed that when the swaying fan stopped
            I would call out to the coolie and bid him pull with a long stroke.
            If the man still slept I would wake him up. He discovered, too,
            that it was a good thing to lie in the wave of air under the
            punkah. Maybe Stanley had taught him all about this in barracks. At
            any rate, when the punkah stopped, Garm would first growl and cock
            his eye at the rope, and if that did not wake the man it nearly
            always did—he would tiptoe forth and talk in the
            sleeper’s ear. Vixen was a clever little dog, but she could
            never connect the punkah and the coolie; so Garm gave me grateful
            hours of cool sleep. But—he was utterly wretched—as
            miserable as a human being; and in his misery he clung so closely
            to me that other men noticed it, and were envious. If I moved from
            one room to another Garm followed; if my pen stopped scratching,
            Garm’s head was thrust into my hand; if I turned, half awake,
            on the pillow, Garm was up and at my side, for he knew that I was
            his only link with his master, and day and night, and night and
            day, his eyes asked one question—“When is this going to
            end?”

         <p><span id="d26e1843">
               <!--anchor1--></span>Living with the dog as I did, I never noticed that he was more
            than ordinarily upset by the hot weather, till one day at the Club
            a man said: “That dog of yours will die in a week or two.
            He’s a shadow.” Then I dosed Garm with iron and
            quinine, which he hated; and I felt very anxious. He lost his
            appetite, and Vixen was allowed to eat his dinner under his eyes.
            Even that did not make him swallow, and we held a consultation on
            him, of the best man-doctor in the place; a lady-doctor, who cured
            the sick wives of kings; and the Deputy Inspector-General of the
            veterinary service of all India. They pronounced upon his symptoms,
            and I told them his story, and Garm lay on a sofa licking my
            hand.

            veterinary Deputy Inspector-General went over it afterwards to be
            sure that the drugs were in the proper dog-proportions; and that
            was the first time in his life that our doctor ever allowed his
            prescriptions to be edited. It was a strong tonic, and it put the
            dear boy on his feet for a week or two; then he lost flesh again. I
            asked a man I knew to take him up to the Hills with him when he
            went, and the man came to the door with his kit packed on the top
            of the carriage. Garm took in the situation at one red glance. The
            hair rose along his back; he sat down in front of me and delivered
            the most awful growl I have ever heard in the jaws of a dog. I
            shouted to my friend to get away at once, and as soon as the
            carriage was out of the garden Garm laid his head on my knee and
            whined. So I knew his answer, and devoted myself to getting
            Stanley’s address in the Hills.

               <!--anchor1--></span>My turn to go to the cool came late in August. We were allowed
            thirty days’ holiday in a year, if no one fell sick, and we
            took it as we could be spared. My chief and Bob the Librarian had
            their holiday first, and when they were gone I made a calendar, as
            I always did, and hung it up at the head of my cot, tearing off one
            day at a time till they returned. Vixen had gone up to the Hills
            with me five times before; and she appreciated the cold and the
            damp and the beautiful wood fires there as much as I did.

               <!--anchor1--></span>“Garm,” I said, “we are going back to Stanley
            at Kasauli. Kasauli—Stanley; Stanley Kasauli.” And I
            repeated it twenty times. It was not Kasauli really, but another
            place. Still I remembered what Stanley had said in my garden on the
            last night, and I dared not change the name. Then Garm began to
            tremble; then he barked; and then he leaped up at me, frisking and
            wagging his tail.

               <!--anchor1--></span>“Not now,” I said, holding up my hand. “When I
            say ‘Go,’ we’ll go, Garm.” I pulled out the
            little blanket coat and spiked collar that Vixen always wore up in
            the Hills to protect her against sudden chills and thieving
            leopards, and I let the two smell them and talk it over. What they
            said of course I do not know; but it made a new dog of Garm. His
            eyes were bright; and he barked joyfully when I spoke to him. He
            ate his food, and he killed his rats for the next three weeks, and
            when he began to whine I had only to say
            “Stanley—Kasauli; Kasauli—Stanley,” to wake
            him up. I wish I had thought of it before.

               <!--anchor1--></span>My chief came back, all brown with living in the open air, and
            very angry at finding it so hot in the plains. That same afternoon
            we three and Kadir Buksh began to pack for our month’s
            holiday, Vixen rolling in and out of the bullock-trunk twenty times
            a minute, and Garm grinning all over and thumping on the floor with
            his tail. Vixen knew the routine of travelling as well as she knew
            my office-work. She went to the station, singing songs, on the
            front seat of the carriage, while Garm sat with me. She hurried
            into the railway carriage, saw Kadir Buksh make up my bed for the
            night, got her drink of water, and curled up with her black-patch
            eye on the tumult of the platform. Garm followed her (the crowd
            gave him a lane all to himself) and sat down on the pillows with
            his eyes blazing, and his tail a haze behind him.

         <p><span id="d26e1868">
               <!--anchor1--></span>We came to Umballa in the hot misty dawn, four or five men, who
            had been working hard for eleven months, shouting for our
            dales—the two-horse travelling carriages that were to take us
            up to Kalka at the foot of the Hills. It was all new to Garm. He
            did not understand carriages where you lay at full length on your
            bedding, but Vixen knew and hopped into her place at once; Garm
            following. The Kalka Road, before the railway was built, was about
            forty-seven miles long, and the horses were changed every eight
            miles. Most of them jibbed, and kicked, and plunged, but they had
            to go, and they went rather better than usual for Garm’s deep
            bay in their rear.

         <p><span id="d26e1871">
               <!--anchor1--></span>There was a river to be forded, and four bullocks pulled the
            carriage, and Vixen stuck her head out of the sliding-door and
            nearly fell into the water while she gave directions. Garm was
            silent and curious, and rather needed reassuring about Stanley and
            Kasauli. So we rolled, barking and yelping, into Kalka for lunch,
            and Garm ate enough for two.

         <p><span id="d26e1874">
               <!--anchor1--></span>After Kalka the road wound among the hills, and we took a
            curricle with half-broken ponies, which were changed every six
            miles. No one dreamed of a railroad to Simla in those days, for it
            was seven thousand feet up in the air. The road was more than fifty
            miles long, and the regulation pace was just as fast as the ponies
            could go. Here, again, Vixen led Garm from one carriage to the
            other; jumped into the back seat, and shouted. A cool breath from
            the snows met us about five miles out of Kalka, and she whined for
            her coat, wisely fearing a chill on the liver. I had had one made
            for Garm too, and, as we climbed to the fresh breezes, I put it on,
            and Garm chewed it uncomprehendingly, but I think he was
            grateful.

               <!--anchor1--></span>“Hi-yi-yi-yi!” sang Vixen as we shot round the
            curves; “Toot-toot-toot!” went the driver’s bugle
            at the dangerous places, and “yow! yow!” bayed Garm.
            Kadir Buksh sat on the front seat and smiled. Even he was glad to
            get away from the heat of the Plains that stewed in the haze behind
            us. Now and then we would meet a man we knew going down to his work
            again, and he would say: “What’s it like below?”
            and I would shout: “Hotter than cinders. What’s it like
            up above?” and he would shout back: “Just
            perfect!” and away we would go.

               <!--anchor1--></span>Suddenly Kadir Buksh said, over his shoulder: “Here is
            Solon”; and Garm snored where he lay with his head on my
            knee. Solon is an unpleasant little cantonment, but it has the
            advantage of being cool and healthy. It is all bare and windy, and
            one generally stops at a rest-house nearby for something to eat. I
            got out and took both dogs with me, while Kadir Buksh made tea. A
            soldier told, us we should find Stanley “out there,”
            nodding his head towards a bare, bleak hill.

            hands, and his overcoat hanging loose about him. I never saw
            anything so lonely and dejected in my life as this one little man,
            crumpled up and thinking, on the great gray hillside.

            whack of him as he flung himself at Stanley, knocking the little
            man clean over. They rolled on the ground together, shouting, and
            yelping, and hugging. I could not see which was dog and which was
            man, till Stanley got up and whimpered.

            both man and dog plumped out to their natural sizes, precisely as
            dried apples swell in water. Garm was on his shoulder, and his
            breast and feet all at the same time, so that Stanley spoke all
            through a cloud of Garm—gulping, sobbing, slavering Garm. He
            did not say anything that I could understand, except that he had
            fancied he was going to die, but that now he was quite well, and
            that he was not going to give up Garm any more to anybody under the

            shoulder. He further escorted us, singing Hosannas at the top of
            his voice, a mile down the road. Then he raced back to his own
            master.

            with her nose at the breast of my ulster. I unbuttoned it, and
            tucked her inside. Then she gave a contented little sniff, and fell
            fast asleep, her head on my breast, till we bundled out at Simla,
