            smoke—-all four house-masters—and the three briars and the one
            cigar reeking in amity proved the Rev. John Gillett's good
            generalship. Since the discovery of the cat, King had been too ready
            to see affront where none was meant, and the Reverend John,
            buffer-state and general confidant, had worked for a week to bring
            about a good understanding. He was fat, clean-shaven, except for a
            big mustache, of an imperturbable good temper, and, those who loved
            him least said, a guileful Jesuit. He smiled benignantly upon his
            handiwork—four sorely tried men talking without very much malice.

            cleanliness—a most delicate matter with all boys. Ve-ry good.
            Observe how, in each case, the punishment fits the crime. A week
            after your house calls them 'stinkers,' King, your house is, not to
            put too fine a point on it, stunk out by a dead cat who chooses to
            die in the one spot where she can annoy you most. Again the long arm
            of coincidence!  <em>Summa</em>. You accuse them of trespass. Through some
            absurd chain of circumstances—they may or may not be at the other
            end of it—you and Prout are made to appear as trespassers. You evict
            them. For a time your study is made untenable. I have drawn the
            parallel in the last case. Well?’

            have pried up the boards without leaving some trace—and
            Rabbits-Eggs was phenomenally drunk that other night.’

            their confidence. I confess I like being called 'Padre.' They are at

            thoroughly sincere and means well.’

            ‘He jumped at some silly tale of theft on their part; accepted
            another boy's evidence without, so far as I can see, any inquiry;
            and—frankly, I think he deserved all he got.’

            opinion, unsound,’ Prout insisted. ‘The moral effect of their
            performances must pave the way for greater harm. It makes me doubtful
            how to deal with them. I might separate them.’

            it; but Beetle is as the brutes that perish about sines and cosines.

            mathematics.’

            direction to Elegiaes.’ King jerked himself upright. ‘He is, with the

            'barbarous hexameters' that I have ever dealt with.’

            the mathematics, McTurk the Latin, and Beetle attends to their

            for Harrison and Craye, reprehending them very gently for the tone
            they had adopted to a repentant sinner, and when they returned to
            their study, they used the language of despair. They then made
            headlong inquisition through the house, driving the fags to the edge
            of hysterics, and unearthing, with tremendous pomp and parade, the
            natural and inevitable system of small loans that prevails among

            outside compulsory games—told them succinctly to go about their
            business. They would not give evidence on any terms. Harrison was one

            steal, crying ’<em>Cave'</em>’ when there is no need of caution, and
            whispering ‘Don't tell!’ on the heels of trumpery confidences that

               <!--anchor1--></span>At the end of a few days, it dawned on Prout that he moved in an
            atmosphere of perpetual ambush. Mysteries hedged him on all sides,
            warnings ran before his heavy feet, and countersigns were muttered
            behind his attentive back. McTurk and Stalky invented many absurd and
            idle phrases—catch-words that swept through the house as fire
            through stubble. It was a rare jest, and the only practical outcome of
            the Usury Commission, that one boy should say to a friend, with awful
            gravity, ‘Do you think there's much of it going on in the house?’ The
            other would reply, ‘Well, one can't be too careful, you know.’ The
            effect on a house-master of humane conscience and good intent may be
            imagined.  Again, a man who has sincerely devoted himself to gaining
            the esteem of his charges does not like to hear himself described,
            even at a distance, as ‘Popularity Prout’ by a dark and scowling Celt
            with a fluent tongue. A rumor that stories—unusual stories—are told
            in the form-rooms, between the lights, by a boy who does not command
            his confidence, agitates such a man; and even elaborate and tender
            politeness—for the courtesy wise-grown men offer to a bewildered
            child was the courtesy that Stalky wrapped round Prout—restores not
            his peace of mind.
