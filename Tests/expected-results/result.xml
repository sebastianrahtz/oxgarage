In retrospect, <hi rend="background(yellow)">it was predictable</hi> that many people should imagine TEI Lite to be all there is to <hi rend="color(FF6600)">TEI, or find TEI Lite</hi> to be far too heavy for their needs.</p><p>The original TEI Lite was based largely on observations of existing and previous practice in the encoding of texts, particularly as manifest in the collections of the <ref target="http://ota.ahds.ac.uk">Oxford Text Archive</ref> and in our own experience. It is therefore unsurprising that it seems to have become, if not a de facto standard, at least a common point of departure for electronic text centres and encoding projects world wide. Maybe the fact that we actually produced this shortish, readable, manual for it also helped.</p><p>Early adopters of TEI Lite included a number of <hi rend="italic">Electronic Text Centers</hi>, many of whom produced their own documentation and tutorial materials (some examples are listed in <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Tutorials">the TEI Tutorials pages</ref>). It was also widely adopted as the basis for TEI-conformant authoring systems. Documentation introducing TEI Lite has been widely used for tutorial purposes and has been widely translated (see further the list of versions at <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org/Lite/">http://www.tei-c.org/Lite/</ref>).</p><p>With the publication of TEI P4, the XML version of the TEI Guidelines, which uses the generation of TEI Lite as an example of the modification mechanism built into the TEI Guidelines, the opportunity was taken to produce a lightly revised XML-conformant version, but the present revision is the first substantively changed version since its first appearance in 1997. This revision takes advantage of the many new features introduced into the TEI Guidelines at release P5. A brief list of those changes likely to affect users of previous versions of this document is given below (). </p><p>Lou Burnard, February 2006</p><p>This document provides an introduction to the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), by describing a specific subset of the full TEI encoding scheme. The scheme documented here can be used to encode a wide variety of commonly encountered textual features, in such a way as to maximize the usability of electronic transcriptions and to facilitate their interchange among scholars using different computer systems. It is fully compatible with the full TEI scheme, as defined by TEI document P5, <hi rend="italic">Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange</hi>, as of February 2006, and available from the TEI Consortium website at <ref target="http://www.tei-c.org">http://www.tei-c.org</ref>. </p><p><anchor xml:id="U5-Intro"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1002"/>Introduction</p><p>The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines are addressed to anyone who wants to interchange information stored in an electronic form. They emphasize the interchange of textual information, but other forms of information such as images and sound are also addressed. The Guidelines are equally applicable in the creation of new resources and in the interchange of existing ones.</p><p>The Guidelines provide a means of making explicit certain features of a text in such a way as to aid the processing of that text by computer programs running on different machines. This process of making explicit we call </p><p><hi rend="bold">markup</hi></p><p> or </p><p><hi rend="bold">encoding</hi></p><p>. Any textual representation on a computer uses some form of markup; the TEI came into being partly because of the enormous variety of mutually incomprehensible encoding schemes currently besetting scholarship, and partly because of the expanding range of scholarly uses now being identified for texts in electronic form.</p><p>The TEI Guidelines describe an encoding scheme which can be expressed using a number of different formal languages. The first editions of the Guidelines used the </p><p><hi rend="bold">Standard Generalized Markup Language</hi></p><p> (SGML); since 2002, this has been replaced by the use of the Extensible Markup Language (XML). These markup languages have in common the definition of text in terms of </p><p><hi rend="bold">elements</hi></p><p> and </p><p><hi rend="bold">attributes</hi></p><p>, and rules governing their appearance within a text. The TEI's use of XML is ambitious in its complexity and generality, but it is fundamentally no different from that of any other XML markup scheme, and so any general-purpose XML-aware software is able to process TEI-conformant texts.</p><p>The TEI was sponsored by the Association for Computers and the Humanities, the Association for Computational Linguistics, and the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing, and is now maintained and developed by an independent membership consortium, hosted by four major Universities. Funding has been provided in part from the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities, Directorate General XIII of the Commission of the European Communities, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada. The Guidelines were first published in May 1994, after six years of development involving many hundreds of scholars from different academic disciplines worldwide. During the years that followed, the Guidelines were increasingly influential in the development of the digital library, in the language industries, and even in the development of the World Wide Web itself. The TEI consortium was set up in January 2001, and a year later produced an edition of the Guidelines entirely revised for XML compatibility. In 2004, it set about a major revision of the Guidelines to take full advantage of new schema languages, the first release of which appeared in 2005. This revision of the TEI Lite manual conforms to version 0.3 of this most recent edition of the Guidelines, TEI P5.</p><p>At the outset of its work, the overall goals of the TEI were defined by the closing statement of a planning conference held at Vassar College, N.Y., in November, 1987; these <hi rend="italic">Poughkeepsie Principles</hi> were further elaborated in a series of design documents. The Guidelines, say these design documents, should: </p><list type="unordered"><item>suffice to represent the textual features needed for research;</item><item>be simple, clear, and concrete;</item><item>be easy for researchers to use without special-purpose software;</item><item>allow the rigorous definition and efficient processing of texts;</item><item>provide for user-defined extensions;</item><item>conform to existing and emergent standards.</item></list><p>The world of scholarship is large and diverse. For the Guidelines to have wide acceptability, it was important to ensure that: </p><list type="ordered"><item>the common core of textual features be easily shared;</item><item>additional specialist features be easy to add to (or remove from) a text;</item><item>multiple parallel encodings of the same feature should be possible;</item><item>the richness of markup should be user-defined, with a very small minimal requirement;</item><item>adequate documentation of the text and its encoding should be provided.</item></list><p>The present document describes a manageable selection from the extensive set of elements and recommendations resulting from those design goals, which is called <hi rend="italic">TEI Lite</hi>.</p><p>In selecting from the several hundred elements defined by the full TEI scheme, we have tried to identify a useful <hi rend="italic">starter set</hi>, comprising the elements which almost every user should know about. Experience working with TEI Lite will be invaluable in understanding the full TEI scheme and in knowing how to integrate specialized parts of it into the general TEI framework.</p><p>Our goals in defining this subset may be summarized as follows: </p><p>it should be able to handle adequately a reasonably wide variety of texts, at the level of detail found in existing practice (as demonstrated in, for example, the holdings of the Oxford Text Archive);</p><p>it should be useful for the production of new documents (such as this one) as well as the encoding of existing texts;</p><p>it should be usable with a wide range of existing XML software;</p><p>it should be derivable from the full TEI scheme using the extension mechanisms described in the TEI Guidelines;</p><p>it should be as small and simple as is consistent with the other goals.</p><p>The reader may judge our success in meeting these goals for him or herself. At the time of first writing (1995), our confidence that we have at least partially done so is borne out by its use in practice for the encoding of real texts. The Oxford Text Archive uses TEI Lite when it translates texts from its holdings from their original markup schemes into SGML; the Electronic Text Centers at the University of Virginia and the University of Michigan have used TEI Lite to encode their holdings. And the Text Encoding Initiative itself uses TEI Lite, in its current technical documentation — including this document. </p><p>Although we have tried to make this document self-contained, as suits a tutorial text, the reader should be aware that it does not cover every detail of the TEI encoding scheme. All of the elements described here are fully documented in the TEI Guidelines themselves, which should be consulted for authoritative reference information on these, and on the many others which are not described here. Some basic knowledge of XML is assumed.</p><p><anchor xml:id="U5-eg"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1003"/>A Short Example</p><p>We begin with a short example, intended to show what happens when a passage of prose is typed into a computer by someone with little sense of the purpose of mark-up, or the potential of electronic texts. In an ideal world, such output might be generated by a very accurate optical scanner. It attempts to be faithful to the appearance of the printed text, by retaining the original line breaks, by introducing blanks to represent the layout of the original headings and page breaks, and so forth. Where characters not available on the keyboard are needed (such as the accented letter a in faàl or the long dash), it attempts to mimic their appearance.</p><p rend="egXML"> CHAPTER 38<lb/><lb/>READER, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the par-<lb/>son and clerk, were alone present. When we got back from church, I<lb/>went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking<lb/>the dinner, and John cleaning the knives, and I said --<lb/> 'Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester this morning.' The<lb/>housekeeper and her husband were of that decent, phlegmatic<lb/>order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a<lb/>remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having<lb/>one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation and subsequently stunned<lb/>by a torrent of wordy wonderment. Mary did look up, and she did<lb/>stare at me; the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens<lb/>roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air,<lb/>and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the<lb/>polishing process; but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only --<lb/> 'Have you, miss? Well, for sure!'<lb/> A short time after she pursued, 'I seed you go out with the master,<lb/>but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed'; and she<lb/>basted away. John, when I turned to him, was grinning from ear to<lb/>ear.<lb/> 'I telled Mary how it would be,' he said: 'I knew what Mr Ed-<lb/>ward' (John was an old servant, and had known his master when he<lb/>was the cadet of the house, therefore he often gave him his Christian<lb/>name) -- 'I knew what Mr Edward would do; and I was certain he<lb/>would not wait long either: and he's done right, for aught I know. I<lb/>wish you joy, miss!' and he politely pulled his forelock.<lb/> 'Thank you, John. Mr Rochester told me to give you and Mary<lb/>this.'<lb/> I put into his hand a five-pound note. Without waiting to hear<lb/>more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time<lb/>after, I caught the words --<lb/> 'She'll happen do better for him nor ony o' t' grand ladies.' And<lb/>again, 'If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faa\l, and varry<lb/>good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see<lb/>that.'<lb/> I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what<lb/>I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted. Diana and<lb/><lb/> 474<lb/><lb/> JANE EYRE 475<lb/><lb/>Mary approved the step unreservedly. Diana announced that she<lb/>would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she<lb/>would come and see me.<lb/> 'She had better not wait till then, Jane,' said Mr Rochester, when I<lb/>read her letter to him; 'if she does, she will be too late, for our honey-<lb/>moon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your<lb/>grave or mine.'<lb/> How St John received the news I don't know: he never answered<lb/>the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he wrote<lb/>to me, without, however, mentioning Mr Rochester's name or allud-<lb/>ing to my marriage. His letter was then calm, and though very serious,<lb/>kind. He has maintained a regular, though not very frequent correspond-<lb/>ence ever since: he hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who<lb/>live without God in the world, and only mind earthly<lb/>things.</p><p>This transcription suffers from a number of shortcomings: </p><list type="unordered"><item>the page numbers and running titles are intermingled with the text in a way which makes it difficult for software to disentangle them;</item><item>no distinction is made between single quotation marks and apostrophe, so it is difficult to know exactly which passages are in direct speech;</item><item>the preservation of the copy text's hyphenation means that simple-minded search programs will not find the broken words;</item><item>the accented letter in faàl and the long dash have been rendered by ad hoc keying conventions which follow no standard pattern and will be processed correctly only if the transcriber remembers to mention them in the documentation;</item><item>paragraph divisions are marked only by the use of white space, and hard carriage returns have been introduced at the end of each line. Consequently, if the size of type used to print the text changes, reformatting will be problematic.</item></list><p>We now present the same passage, as it might be encoded using the TEI Guidelines.

The decision to focus on Brontë's text, rather than on the printing of it in this particular edition, is an instance of the fundamental <hi rend="italic">selectivity</hi> of any encoding. An encoding makes explicit only those textual features of importance to the encoder. It is not difficult to think of ways in which the encoding of even this short passage might readily be extended. For example: </p><p>a regularized form of the passages in dialect could be provided;</p><p>footnotes glossing or commenting on any passage could be added;</p><p>pointers linking parts of this text to others could be added;</p><p>proper names of various kinds could be distinguished from the surrounding text;</p><p>detailed bibliographic information about the text's provenance and context could be prefixed to it;</p><p>a linguistic analysis of the passage into sentences, clauses, words, etc., could be provided, each unit being associated with appropriate category codes;</p><p>the text could be segmented into narrative or discourse units;</p><p>systematic analysis or interpretation of the text could be included in the encoding, with potentially complex alignment or linkage between the text and the analysis, or between the text and one or more translations of it;</p><p>passages in the text could be linked to images or sound held on other media.</p><p>A TEI-recommended way of carrying out most of these is described in the remainder of this document. The TEI scheme as a whole also provides for an enormous range of other possibilities, of which we cite only a few: </p><p>detailed analysis of the components of names;</p><p>detailed meta-information providing thesaurus-style information about the text's origins or topics;</p><p>information about the printing history or manuscript variations exhibited by a particular series of versions of the text.</p><p> For recommendations on these and many other possibilities, the full Guidelines should be consulted.</p><p><anchor xml:id="U5-struc"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1004"/>The Structure of a TEI Text</p><p>All TEI-conformant texts contain (a) a </p><p><hi rend="bold">TEI header</hi></p><p> (marked up as a &lt;teiHeader&gt; element) and (b) the transcription of the text proper (marked up as a &lt;text&gt; element). These two elements are combined together to form a single &lt;TEI&gt; element. </p><p>The TEI header provides information analogous to that provided by the title page of a printed text. It has up to four parts: a bibliographic description of the machine-readable text, a description of the way it has been encoded, a non-bibliographic description of the text (a </p><p><hi rend="bold">text profile</hi></p><p>), and a revision history. The header is described in more detail in section 19.</p><p>A TEI text may be </p><p><hi rend="bold">unitary</hi></p><p> (a single work) or </p><p><hi rend="bold">composite</hi></p><p> (a collection of single works, such as an anthology). In either case, the text may have an optional </p><p><hi rend="bold">front</hi></p><p> or </p><p><hi rend="bold">back</hi></p><p>. In between is the </p><p><hi rend="bold">body</hi></p><p> of the text, which, in the case of a composite text, may consist of </p><p><hi rend="bold">group</hi></p><p>s, each containing more groups or texts.</p><p>A unitary text will be encoded using an overall structure like this: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">TEI</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">teiHeader</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- [ TEI Header information ] --&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">teiHeader</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">text</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">front</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- [ front matter ... ] --&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">front</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">body</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- [ body of text ... ] --&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">body</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">back</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- [ back matter ... ] --&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">back</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">text</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">TEI</hi>&gt;</p><p>A composite text also has an optional front and back.

In this section we discuss the elements making up the body of a text. </p><p><anchor xml:id="divs"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1006"/>Text Division Elements</p><p>The body of a prose text may be just a series of paragraphs, or these paragraphs may be grouped together into chapters, sections, subsections, etc. Each paragraph is tagged using the &lt;p&gt; tag. The &lt;div&gt; element is used to represent any such grouping of paragraphs. </p><p>The <hi rend="italic">type</hi> attribute on the &lt;div&gt; element may be used to supply a conventional name for this category of text division, or otherwise distinguish them. Typical values might be ‘book’, ‘chapter’, ‘section’, ‘part’, ‘poem’, ‘song’, etc. For a given project, it will usually be advisable to define and adhere to a specific list of such values. </p><p>A &lt;div&gt; element may itself contain further, nested, &lt;div&gt;s, thus mimicking the traditional structure of a book, which can be decomposed hierarchically into units such as parts, containing chapters, containing sections, and so on. TEI texts in general conform to this simple hierarchic model.</p><p> The <hi rend="italic">xml:id</hi> attribute may be used to supply a unique identifier for the division, which may be used for cross references or other links to it, such as a commentary, as further discussed in section 8. It is often useful to provide an <hi rend="italic">xml:id</hi> attribute for every major structural unit in a text, and to derive its values in some systematic way, for example by appending a section number to a short code for the title of the work in question, as in the examples below.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">n</hi> attribute may be used to supply (additionally or alternatively) a short mnemonic name or number for the division. If a conventional form of reference or abbreviation for the parts of a work already exists (such as the book/chapter/verse pattern of Biblical citations), the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> attribute is the place to record it.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">xml:lang</hi> attribute may be used to specify the language of the division. Languages are identified by an internationally defined code, as further discussed in section 6.3 below.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">rend</hi> attribute may be used to supply information about the rendition (appearance) of a division, or any other element, as further discussed in section 6 below. As with the <hi rend="italic">type</hi> attribute, a project will often find it useful to predefine the possible values for this attribute, but TEI Lite does not constrain it in anyway. </p><p> These four attributes, <hi rend="italic">xml:id</hi>, <hi rend="italic">n</hi>, <hi rend="italic">xml:lang</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">rend</hi> are so widely useful that they are allowed on any element in any TEI schema: they are </p><p><hi rend="bold">global attributes</hi></p><p>. Other global attributes defined in the TEI Lite scheme are discussed in section 8.3.</p><p>The value of every <hi rend="italic">xml:id</hi> attribute should be unique within a document. One simple way of ensuring that this is so is to make it reflect the hierarchic structure of the document. For example, Smith's <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations</hi> as first published consists of five books, each of which is divided into chapters, while some chapters are further subdivided into parts. We might define <hi rend="italic">xml:id</hi> values for this structure as follows: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">body</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="WN1" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="I" <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="book"&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="WN101" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="I.1" <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="chapter"&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="WN102" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="I.2" <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="chapter"&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="WN110" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="I.10" <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="chapter"&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="WN1101" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="I.10.1" <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="part"&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/>   &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="WN1102" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="I.10.2" <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="part"&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/>   &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="WN2" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="II" <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="book"&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">body</hi>&gt;</p><p>A different numbering scheme may be used for <hi rend="italic">xml:id</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> attributes: this is often useful where a canonical reference scheme is used which does not tally with the structure of the work. For example, in a novel divided into books each containing chapters, where the chapters are numbered sequentially through the whole work, rather than within each book, one might use a scheme such as the following: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">body</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="TS01" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="1" <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="Volume"&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="TS011" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="1" <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="Chapter"&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="TS012" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="2"&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="TS02" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="2" <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="Volume"&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="TS021" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="3" <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="Chapter"&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="TS022" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="4"&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">body</hi>&gt;</p><p> Here the work has two volumes, each containing two chapters. The chapters are numbered conventionally 1 to 4, but the <hi rend="italic">xml:id</hi> values specified allow them to be regarded additionally as if they were numbered 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2.</p><p><anchor xml:id="h25"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1007"/>Headings and Closings</p><p>Every &lt;div&gt; may have a title or heading at its start, and (less commonly) a closing such as ‘End of Chapter 1’. The following elements may be used to transcribe them: </p><p> Some other elements which may be necessary at the beginning or ending of text divisions are discussed below in section 18.1.2.</p><p>Whether or not headings and trailers are included in a transcription is a matter for the individual transcriber to decide. Where a heading is completely regular (for example ‘Chapter 1’) or may be automatically constructed from attribute values (e.g. &lt;div type="Chapter" n="1"&gt;), it may be omitted; where it contains otherwise unrecoverable text it should always be included. For example, the start of Hardy's <hi rend="italic">Under the Greenwood Tree</hi> might be encoded as follows: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="UGT1" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="Winter" <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="Part"&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="UGT11" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="1" <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="Chapter"&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;Mellstock-Lane&lt;/<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;To dwellers in a wood almost every species of tree ...<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;</p><p><anchor xml:id="vedr"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1008"/>Prose, Verse and Drama</p><p>As noted above, the paragraphs making up a textual division should be tagged with the &lt;p&gt; tag. For example: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;I fully appreciate Gen. Pope's splendid achievements<lb/> with their invaluable results; but you must know that<lb/> Major Generalships in the Regular Army, are not as<lb/> plenty as blackberries.<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;</p><p>A number of different tags are provided for the encoding of the structural components of verse and performance texts (drama, film, etc.): </p><p>Here, for example, is the start of a poetic text in which verse lines and stanzas are tagged: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">lg</hi> <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="I"&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;I Sing the progresse of a<lb/>   deathlesse soule,&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;Whom Fate, with God made,<lb/>   but doth not controule,&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;Plac'd in most shapes; all times<lb/>   before the law&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;Yoak'd us, and when, and since,<lb/>   in this I sing.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;And the great world to his aged evening;&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;From infant morne, through manly noone I draw.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;What the gold Chaldee, of silver Persian saw,&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;Greeke brass, or Roman iron, is in this one;&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;A worke t'out weare Seths pillars, bricke and stone,&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;And (holy writs excepted) made to yeeld to none,&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">lg</hi>&gt;</p><p>Note that the &lt;l&gt; element marks verse lines, not typographic lines: the original lineation of the first few lines above has not therefore been made explicit by this encoding, and may be lost. The &lt;lb&gt; element described in section 5 may be used to mark typographic lines if so desired.</p><p>Sometimes, particularly in dramatic texts, verse lines are split between speakers. The easiest way of encoding this is to use the <hi rend="italic">part</hi> attribute to indicate that the lines so fragmented are incomplete, as in this example: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="Act" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="I"&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;ACT I&lt;/<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="Scene" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="1"&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;SCENE I&lt;/<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">stage</hi> <hi rend="bold">rend</hi>="italic"&gt;Enter Barnardo and Francisco, two Sentinels, at several doors&lt;/<hi rend="bold">stage</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">sp</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">speaker</hi>&gt;Barn&lt;/<hi rend="bold">speaker</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi> <hi rend="bold">part</hi>="Y"&gt;Who's there?&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">sp</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">sp</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">speaker</hi>&gt;Fran&lt;/<hi rend="bold">speaker</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;Nay, answer me.

The names used for types of unit and for editions referred to by the <hi rend="italic">ed</hi> and <hi rend="italic">unit</hi> attributes may be chosen freely, but should be documented in the header.

For example, a heading rendered in bold might be tagged &lt;head rend="bold"&gt;, and one in italic &lt;head rend="italic"&gt;.</p><p>It is not always possible or desirable to interpret the reasons for such changes of rendering in a text. In such cases, the element &lt;hi&gt; may be used to mark a sequence of highlighted text without making any claim as to its status. </p><p>In the following example, the use of a distinct typeface for the subheading and for the included name are recorded but not interpreted: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">hi</hi> <hi rend="bold">rend</hi>="gothic"&gt;And this Indenture further witnesseth&lt;/<hi rend="bold">hi</hi>&gt;<lb/> that the said &lt;<hi rend="bold">hi</hi> <hi rend="bold">rend</hi>="italic"&gt;Walter Shandy&lt;/<hi rend="bold">hi</hi>&gt;, merchant,<lb/> in consideration of the said intended marriage ...<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;</p><p>Alternatively, where the cause for the highlighting can be identified with confidence, a number of other, more specific, elements are available. </p><p>Some features (notably quotations and glosses) may be found in a text either marked by highlighting, or with quotation marks. In either case, the elements &lt;q&gt; and &lt;gloss&gt; (as discussed in the following section) should be used. If the rendition is to be recorded, use the global <hi rend="italic">rend</hi> attribute.</p><p>As an example of the elements defined here, consider the following sentence: ‘On the one hand the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied</hi> is associated with the new rise of romance of twelfth-century France, the <hi rend="italic">romans d'antiquité</hi>, the romances of Chrétien de Troyes, and the German adaptations of these works by Heinrich van Veldeke, Hartmann von Aue, and Wolfram von Eschenbach.’ Interpreting the role of the highlighting, the sentence might look like this: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;On the one hand the &lt;<hi rend="bold">title</hi>&gt;Nibelungenlied&lt;/<hi rend="bold">title</hi>&gt; is associated<lb/> with the new rise of romance of twelfth-century France, the<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">foreign</hi>&gt;romans d'antiquité&lt;/<hi rend="bold">foreign</hi>&gt;, the romances of<lb/> Chrétien de Troyes, ...&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;</p><p> Describing only the appearance of the original, it might look like this: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;On the one hand the &lt;<hi rend="bold">hi</hi> <hi rend="bold">rend</hi>="italic"&gt;Nibelungenlied&lt;/<hi rend="bold">hi</hi>&gt;<lb/> is associated with the new rise of romance of twelfth-century<lb/> France, the &lt;<hi rend="bold">hi</hi> <hi rend="bold">rend</hi>="italic"&gt;romans<lb/>   d'antiquité&lt;/<hi rend="bold">hi</hi>&gt;, the romances of<lb/> Chrétien de Troyes, ...&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;</p><p><anchor xml:id="z635"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1012"/>Quotations and Related Features</p><p>Like changes of typeface, quotation marks are conventionally used to denote several different features within a text, of which the most frequent is quotation.

This may also be used to indicate the kind of quotation marks used.</p><p>Direct speech interrupted by a narrator can be represented simply by ending the quotation and beginning it again after the interruption, as in the following example: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt;Who-e debel you?&lt;/<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt; — he at last said — &lt;<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt;you<lb/>   no speak-e, damme, I kill-e.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt; And so saying, the lighted<lb/> tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark.<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;</p><p> If it is important to convey the idea that the two &lt;q&gt; elements together make up a single speech, the linking attributes <hi rend="italic">next</hi> and <hi rend="italic">prev</hi> may be used, as described in section 8.3.</p><p>Quotations may be accompanied by a reference to the source or speaker, using the <hi rend="italic">who</hi> attribute, whether or not the source is given in the text, as in the following example: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">q</hi> <hi rend="bold">who</hi>="Wilson"&gt;Spaulding, he came down into the office just this<lb/> day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand, and he<lb/> says:—&lt;<hi rend="bold">q</hi> <hi rend="bold">who</hi>="Spaulding"&gt;I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that<lb/>   I was a red-headed man.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt;</p><p> This example also demonstrates how quotations may be embedded within other quotations: one speaker (Wilson) quotes another speaker (Spaulding).</p><p>The creator of the electronic text must decide whether quotation marks are replaced by the tags or whether the tags are added and the quotation marks kept. If the quotation marks are removed from the text, the <hi rend="italic">rend</hi> attribute may be used to record the way in which they were rendered in the copy text.</p><p>As with highlighting, it is not always possible and may not be considered desirable to interpret the function of quotation marks in a text in this way. In such cases, the tag &lt;hi rend="quoted"&gt; might be used to mark quoted text without making any claim as to its status.</p><p><anchor xml:id="z636"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1013"/>Foreign Words or Expressions</p><p>Words or phrases which are not in the main language of the texts may be tagged as such in one of two ways. If the word or phrase is already tagged for some reason, the element indicated should bear a value for the global <hi rend="italic">xml:lang</hi> attribute indicating the language used. Where there is no applicable element, the element &lt;foreign&gt; may be used, again using the <hi rend="italic">xml:lang</hi> attribute. For example: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;John has real<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">foreign</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:lang</hi>="fra"&gt;savoir-faire&lt;/<hi rend="bold">foreign</hi>&gt;.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;Have you read &lt;<hi rend="bold">title</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:lang</hi>="deu"&gt;Die Dreigroschenoper&lt;/<hi rend="bold">title</hi>&gt;?&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">mentioned</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:lang</hi>="fra"&gt;Savoir-faire&lt;/<hi rend="bold">mentioned</hi>&gt; is French for<lb/> know-how.<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;The court issued a writ of &lt;<hi rend="bold">term</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:lang</hi>="lat"&gt;mandamus&lt;/<hi rend="bold">term</hi>&gt;.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;</p><p>As these examples show, the &lt;foreign&gt; element should not be used to tag foreign words if some other more specific element such as &lt;title&gt;, &lt;mentioned&gt;, or &lt;term&gt; applies. The global <hi rend="italic">xml:lang</hi> attribute may be attached to any element to show that it uses some other language than that of the surrounding text.</p><p>The codes used to identify languages, supplied on the <hi rend="italic">xml:lang</hi> attribute, must be constructed in a particular way, and must conform to common Internet standards<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn1" n="1"><p> The relevant standards are RFC 3066, and the lists of two and three language identifiers maintained as part of ISO 639 (see http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ert/iso639.htm)</p></note> , as further explained in the relevant section of the TEI Guidelines.

This may not be possible for example with marginalia, which may not be anchored to an exact location. For simplicity, it may be adequate to position marginal notes before the relevant paragraph or other element. Notes may also be placed in a separate division of the text (as end-notes are, in printed books) and linked to the relevant portion of the text using their <hi rend="italic">target</hi> attribute.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">n</hi> attribute may be used to supply the number or identifier of a note if this is required. The <hi rend="italic">resp</hi> attribute should be used consistently to distinguish between authorial and editorial notes, if the work has both kinds; otherwise, the TEI header should state which kind they are.</p><p>Examples: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;Collections are ensembles of distinct<lb/> entities or objects of any sort.<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">note</hi> <hi rend="bold">place</hi>="foot" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="1"&gt;We explain below why we use the uncommon term<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">mentioned</hi>&gt;collection&lt;/<hi rend="bold">mentioned</hi>&gt;<lb/>   instead of the expected &lt;<hi rend="bold">mentioned</hi>&gt;set&lt;/<hi rend="bold">mentioned</hi>&gt;.<lb/>   Our usage corresponds to the &lt;<hi rend="bold">mentioned</hi>&gt;aggregate&lt;/<hi rend="bold">mentioned</hi>&gt;<lb/>   of many mathematical writings and to the sense of<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">mentioned</hi>&gt;class&lt;/<hi rend="bold">mentioned</hi>&gt; found<lb/>   in older logical writings.<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">note</hi>&gt;<lb/> The elements ...&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;</p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">lg</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="RAM609"&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">note</hi> <hi rend="bold">place</hi>="margin"&gt;The curse is finally expiated&lt;/<hi rend="bold">note</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;And now this spell was snapt: once more&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;I viewed the ocean green,&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;And looked far forth, yet little saw&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;Of what had else been seen —&lt;/<hi rend="bold">l</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">lg</hi>&gt;</p><p><anchor xml:id="U5-ptrs"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1015"/>Cross References and Links</p><p>Explicit cross references or links from one point in a text to another in the same or another document may be encoded using the elements described in this section. Implicit links (such as the association between two parallel texts, or that between a text and its interpretation) may be encoded using the linking attributes discussed in section 8.3.</p><p><anchor xml:id="ptrs"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1016"/>Simple Cross References</p><p>A cross reference from one point within a single document to another can be encoded using either of the following elements: </p><p>The difference between these two elements is that &lt;ptr&gt; is an empty element, simply marking a point from which a link is to be made, whereas &lt;ref&gt; may contain some text as well — typically the text of the cross-reference itself. The &lt;ptr&gt; element would be used for a cross reference which is to be indicated by some non-verbal means such as a symbol or icon, or in an electronic text by a button. It is also useful in document production systems, where the formatter can generate the correct verbal form of the cross reference.</p><p>The following two forms, for example, are logically equivalent (assuming we have documented somewhere the exact verbal form of cross references represented by &lt;ptr&gt; elements): </p><p>See especially &lt;<hi rend="bold">ref</hi> <hi rend="bold">target</hi>="#SEC12"&gt;section 12 on page<lb/> 34&lt;/<hi rend="bold">ref</hi>&gt;.</p><p>See especially &lt;<hi rend="bold">ptr</hi> <hi rend="bold">target</hi>="#SEC12"/&gt;.</p><p> The value of the <hi rend="italic">target</hi> attribute must have been used as the identifier of some other element within the current document. This implies that the passage or phrase being pointed at must bear an identifier, and must therefore be tagged as an element of some kind. In the following example, the cross reference is to a &lt;div&gt; element: </p><p> ...<lb/> see especially &lt;<hi rend="bold">ptr</hi> <hi rend="bold">target</hi>="#SEC12"/&gt;.<lb/> ...<lb/><lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="SEC12"&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;Concerning Identifiers&lt;/<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;</p><p>Because the <hi rend="italic">xml:id</hi> attribute is global, any element in a document may be pointed to in this way. In the following example, a paragraph has been given an identifier so that it may be pointed at: </p><p> ...<lb/> this is discussed in &lt;<hi rend="bold">ref</hi> <hi rend="bold">target</hi>="#pspec"&gt;the paragraph on links&lt;/<hi rend="bold">ref</hi>&gt;<lb/> ...<lb/><lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="pspec"&gt;Links may be made to any kind of element<lb/> ...&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;</p><p>Sometimes the target of a cross reference does not correspond with any particular feature of a text, and so may not be tagged as an element of some kind. If the desired target is simply a point in the current document, the easiest way to mark it is by introducing an &lt;anchor&gt; element at the appropriate spot. If the target is some sequence of words not otherwise tagged, the &lt;seg&gt; element may be introduced to mark them. These two elements are described as follows: </p><p>In the following (imaginary) example, &lt;ref&gt; elements have been used to represent points in this text which are to be linked in some way to other parts of it; in the first case to a point, and in the second, to a sequence of words: </p><p> Returning to &lt;<hi rend="bold">ref</hi> <hi rend="bold">target</hi>="#ABCD"&gt;the point where I dozed<lb/> off&lt;/<hi rend="bold">ref</hi>&gt;, I noticed that &lt;<hi rend="bold">ref</hi> <hi rend="bold">target</hi>="#EFGH"&gt;three<lb/> words&lt;/<hi rend="bold">ref</hi>&gt; had been circled in red by a previous reader</p><p>This encoding requires that elements with the specified identifiers (<hi rend="italic">ABCD</hi> and <hi rend="italic">EFGH</hi> in this example) are to be found somewhere else in the current document. Assuming that no element already exists to carry these identifiers, the &lt;anchor&gt; and &lt;seg&gt; elements may be used: </p><p> .... &lt;<hi rend="bold">anchor</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="bookmark" <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="ABCD"/&gt; ....<lb/> ....&lt;<hi rend="bold">seg</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="target" <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="EFGH"&gt; ... &lt;/<hi rend="bold">seg</hi>&gt; ...</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">type</hi> attribute should be used (as above) to distinguish amongst different purposes for which these general purpose elements might be used in a text. Some other uses are discussed in section 8.3 below.</p><p><anchor xml:id="xptrs"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1017"/>Pointing to other documents</p><p>So far, we have shown how the elements &lt;ptr&gt; and &lt;ref&gt; may be used for cross-references or links whose targets occur within the same document as their source. However, the same elements may also be used to refer to elements in any other XML document or resource, such as a document on the web, or a database component. This is possible because the value of the <hi rend="italic">target</hi> attribute may be any valid </p><p><hi rend="bold">universal resource indicator</hi></p><p> (URI). A full definition of this term, defined by the W3C (the consortium which manages the development and maintenance of the World Wide Web), is beyond the scope of this tutorial: however, the most frequently encountered version of a URI is the familiar <hi rend="italic">URL</hi> used to indicate a web page, such as http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml. </p><p>A URL may reference a web page or just a part of one, for example http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml#SEC2. The sharp sign indicates that what follows it is the identifier of an element to be located within the XML document identified by what precedes it: this example will therefore locate an element which has an <hi rend="italic">xml:id</hi> attribute value of SEC2 within the document retrieved from http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml. In the examples we have discussed so far, the part to the left of the sharp sign has been omitted: this is understood to mean that the referenced element is to be located within the current document.</p><p>Within a URL, parts of an XML document can be specified by means of other more sophisticated mechanisms, using a special language called Xpath, also defined by the W3C. This is particularly useful where the elements to be linked to do not bear identifiers and must therefore be located by some other means. A full specification of the language is well beyond the scope of this document; here we provide only a flavour of its power. </p><p>In the XPath language, locations are defined as a series of </p><p><hi rend="bold">steps</hi></p><p>, each one identifying some part of the document, often in terms of the locations identified by the previous step. For example, you would point to the third sentence of the second paragraph of chapter two by selecting chapter two in the first step, the second paragraph in the second step, and the third sentence in the last step. A step can be defined in terms of the document tree itself, using such concepts as parent, descendent, preceding, etc. or, more loosely, in terms of text patterns, word or character positions. </p><p><anchor xml:id="xatts"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1018"/>Special kinds of Linking</p><p>The following special purpose </p><p><hi rend="bold">linking</hi></p><p> attributes are defined for every element in the TEI Lite scheme: </p><p><hi rend="italic bold">ana</hi><lb/>links an element with its interpretation.</p><p><hi rend="italic bold">corresp</hi><lb/>links an element with one or more other corresponding elements.</p><p><hi rend="italic bold">next</hi><lb/>links an element to the next element in an aggregate.</p><p><hi rend="italic bold">prev</hi><lb/>links an element to the previous element in an aggregate.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">ana</hi> (analysis) attribute is intended for use where a set of abstract analyses or interpretations have been defined somewhere within a document, as further discussed in section 15. For example, a linguistic analysis of the sentence ‘John loves Nancy’ might be encoded as follows: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">seg</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="sentence" <hi rend="bold">ana</hi>="SVO"&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">seg</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="lex" <hi rend="bold">ana</hi>="#NP1"&gt;John&lt;/<hi rend="bold">seg</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">seg</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="lex" <hi rend="bold">ana</hi>="#VVI"&gt;loves&lt;/<hi rend="bold">seg</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">seg</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="lex" <hi rend="bold">ana</hi>="#NP1"&gt;Nancy&lt;/<hi rend="bold">seg</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">seg</hi>&gt;</p><p> This encoding implies the existence elsewhere in the document of elements with identifiers SVO, NP1, and VV1 where the significance of these particular codes is explained. Note the use of the &lt;seg&gt; element to mark particular components of the analysis, distinguished by the <hi rend="italic">type</hi> attribute.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">corresp</hi> (corresponding) attribute provides a simple way of representing some form of correspondence between two elements in a text. For example, in a multilingual text, it may be used to link translation equivalents, as in the following example </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">seg</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:lang</hi>="fra" <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="FR1" <hi rend="bold">corresp</hi>="#EN1"&gt;Jean aime Nancy&lt;/<hi rend="bold">seg</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">seg</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:lang</hi>="en" <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="EN1" <hi rend="bold">corresp</hi>="#FR1"&gt;John loves Nancy&lt;/<hi rend="bold">seg</hi>&gt;</p><p>The same mechanism may be used for a variety of purposes. In the following example, it has been used to represent anaphoric correspondences between ‘the show’ and ‘Shirley’, and between ‘NBC’ and ‘the network’: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">title</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="shirley"&gt;Shirley&lt;/<hi rend="bold">title</hi>&gt;, which made<lb/> its Friday night debut only a month ago, was<lb/> not listed on &lt;<hi rend="bold">name</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="nbc"&gt;NBC&lt;/<hi rend="bold">name</hi>&gt;'s new schedule,<lb/> although &lt;<hi rend="bold">seg</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="network" <hi rend="bold">corresp</hi>="#nbc"&gt;the network&lt;/<hi rend="bold">seg</hi>&gt;<lb/> says &lt;<hi rend="bold">seg</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="show" <hi rend="bold">corresp</hi>="#shirley"&gt;the show&lt;/<hi rend="bold">seg</hi>&gt;<lb/> still is being considered.<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">next</hi> and <hi rend="italic">prev</hi> attributes provide a simple way of linking together the components of a discontinuous element, as in the following example: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">q</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="Q1a" <hi rend="bold">next</hi>="#Q1b"&gt;Who-e debel you?&lt;/<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt;<lb/> — he at last said — &lt;<hi rend="bold">q</hi> <hi rend="bold">xml:id</hi>="Q1b" <hi rend="bold">prev</hi>="#Q1a"&gt;you no speak-e,<lb/> damme, I kill-e.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt; And so saying,<lb/> the lighted tomahawk began flourishing<lb/> about me in the dark.</p><p><anchor xml:id="U5-edit1"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1019"/>Editorial Interventions</p><p>The process of encoding an electronic text has much in common with the process of editing a manuscript or other text for printed publication. In either case a conscientious editor may wish to record both the original state of the source and any editorial correction or other change made in it. The elements discussed in this and the next section provide some facilities for meeting these needs.</p><p><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1020"/>Correction and Normalization</p><p>The following elements may be used to mark </p><p><hi rend="bold">correction</hi></p><p>, that is editorial changes introduced where the editor believes the original to be erroneous: </p><p>The following elements may be used to mark </p><p><hi rend="bold">normalization</hi></p><p>, that is editorial changes introduced for the sake of consistency or modernization of a text: </p><p>As an example, consider this extract from the quarto printing of Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">Henry V</hi>. </p><p rend="egXML"> ... for his nose was as sharp as a pen and a table of green<lb/>feelds</p><p>A modern editor might wish to make a number of interventions here, specifically to modernize (or normalise) the Elizabethan spellings of a' and feelds for he and fields respectively. He or she might also want to emend table to babbl'd, following an editorial tradition that goes back to the 18th century Shakesperean scholar Theobald.

This element is particularly useful in the transcription of manuscript materials. For example, the character p with a bar through its descender as a conventional representation for the word per is commonly encountered in Medieval European manuscripts. An encoder may choose to expand this as follows: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">expan</hi>&gt;per&lt;/<hi rend="bold">expan</hi>&gt;</p><p>The expansion corresponding with an abbreviated form may not always contain the same letters as the abbreviation. Where it does, however, common editorial practice is to italicize or otherwise signal which letters have been supplied. The &lt;expan&gt; element should not be used for this purpose since its function is to indicate an expanded form, not a part of one. For example, consider the common abbreviation wt (for with) found in medieval texts. In a modern edition, an editor might wish to represent this as <hi rend="italic">w</hi><hi rend="bold">i</hi><hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="bold">h</hi>, italicising the letters not found in the source. An appropriate encoding for this purpose would be </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">expan</hi>&gt;w&lt;<hi rend="bold">hi</hi>&gt;i&lt;/<hi rend="bold">hi</hi>&gt;t&lt;<hi rend="bold">hi</hi>&gt;h&lt;/<hi rend="bold">hi</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">expan</hi>&gt;</p><p>To record both an abbreviation and its expansion, the &lt;choice&gt; element mentioned above may be used to group the abbreviated form with its proposed expansion: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">choice</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">abbr</hi>&gt;wt&lt;/<hi rend="bold">abbr</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">expan</hi>&gt;with&lt;/<hi rend="bold">expan</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">choice</hi>&gt;</p><p><anchor xml:id="U5-names"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1023"/>Names, Dates, and Numbers</p><p>The TEI scheme defines elements for a large number of <hi rend="italic">data-like</hi> features which may appear almost anywhere within almost any kind of text. These features may be of particular interest in a range of disciplines; they all relate to objects external to the text itself, such as the names of persons and places, numbers and dates. They also pose particular problems for many natural language processing (NLP) applications because of the variety of ways in which they may be presented within a text. The elements described here, by making such features explicit, reduce the complexity of processing texts containing them.</p><p><anchor xml:id="nomen"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1024"/>Names and Referring Strings</p><p>A </p><p><hi rend="bold">referring string</hi></p><p> is a phrase which refers to some person, place, object, etc. Two elements are provided to mark such strings: </p><p> The <hi rend="italic">type</hi> attribute is used to distinguish amongst (for example) names of persons, places and organizations, where this is possible: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt;My dear &lt;<hi rend="bold">rs</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="person"&gt;Mr. Bennet&lt;/<hi rend="bold">rs</hi>&gt;, &lt;/<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt;<lb/> said his lady to him one day, <lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt;have you heard<lb/> that &lt;<hi rend="bold">rs</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="place"&gt;Netherfield Park&lt;/<hi rend="bold">rs</hi>&gt; is let<lb/> at last?&lt;/<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt;</p><p>It being one of the principles of the<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">rs</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="organization"&gt;Circumlocution Office&lt;/<hi rend="bold">rs</hi>&gt; never,<lb/> on any account whatsoever, to give a straightforward answer,<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">rs</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="person"&gt;Mr Barnacle&lt;/<hi rend="bold">rs</hi>&gt; said, <lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt;Possibly.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt;</p><p>As the following example shows, the &lt;rs&gt; element may be used for any reference to a person, place, etc, not necessarily one in the form of a proper noun or noun phrase. </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt;My dear &lt;<hi rend="bold">rs</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="person"&gt;Mr. Bennet&lt;/<hi rend="bold">rs</hi>&gt;,&lt;/<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt;<lb/> said &lt;<hi rend="bold">rs</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="person"&gt;his lady&lt;/<hi rend="bold">rs</hi>&gt; to him<lb/> one day...</p><p>The &lt;name&gt; element by contrast is provided for the special case of referencing strings which consist only of proper nouns; it may be used synonymously with the &lt;rs&gt; element, or nested within it if a referring string contains a mixture of common and proper nouns.</p><p>Simply tagging something as a name is rarely enough to enable automatic processing of personal names into the canonical forms usually required for reference purposes. The name as it appears in the text may be inconsistently spelled, partial, or vague. Moreover, name prefixes such as van or de la, may or may not be included as part of the reference form of a name, depending on the language and country of origin of the bearer.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">key</hi> attribute provides an alternative normalized identifier for the object being named, like a database record key.

In natural-language processing or machine-translation applications, it is often helpful to distinguish them from other, more <hi rend="italic">lexical</hi> parts of the text.

Here, for example, a glossary list contains two items, each of which is itself a simple list: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">list</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="gloss"&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">label</hi>&gt;EVIL&lt;/<hi rend="bold">label</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">list</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="simple"&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;I am cast upon a horrible desolate island, void<lb/>       of all hope of recovery.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;I am singled out and separated as it were from<lb/>       all the world to be miserable.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;I am divided from mankind — a solitaire; one<lb/>       banished from human society.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">list</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">label</hi>&gt;GOOD&lt;/<hi rend="bold">label</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">list</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="simple"&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;But I am alive; and not drowned, as all my<lb/>       ship's company were.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;But I am singled out, too, from all the ship's<lb/>       crew, to be spared from death...&lt;/<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;But I am not starved, and perishing on a barren place,<lb/>       affording no sustenances....&lt;/<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">list</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">item</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">list</hi>&gt;</p><p>A list need not necessarily be displayed in list format.

The element &lt;bibl&gt; is provided for this purpose. Where the components of a bibliographic reference are to be distinguished, the following elements may be used as appropriate. It is generally useful to mark at least those parts (such as the titles of articles, books, and journals) which will need special formatting. The other elements are provided for cases where particular interest attaches to such details. </p><p>For example, the following editorial note might be transcribed as shown: ‘He was a member of Parliament for Warwickshire in 1445, and died March 14, 1470 (according to Kittredge, <hi rend="italic">Harvard Studies</hi> 5. 88ff).’</p><p>He was a member of Parliament for Warwickshire in 1445, and died<lb/> March 14, 1470 (according to &lt;<hi rend="bold">bibl</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">author</hi>&gt;Kittredge&lt;/<hi rend="bold">author</hi>&gt;,<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">title</hi>&gt;Harvard Studies&lt;/<hi rend="bold">title</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">biblScope</hi>&gt;5. 88ff&lt;/<hi rend="bold">biblScope</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">bibl</hi>&gt;).</p><p>For lists of bibliographic citations, the &lt;listBibl&gt; element should be used; it may contain a series of &lt;bibl&gt; elements. </p><p><anchor xml:id="U5-tables"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1029"/>Tables</p><p>Tables represent a challenge for any text processing system, but simple tables, at least, appear in so many texts that even in the simplified TEI tag set presented here, markup for tables is necessary. The following elements are provided for this purpose: </p><p>For example, Defoe uses mortality tables like the following in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Plague Year</hi> to show the rise and ebb of the epidemic:</p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;It was indeed coming on amain, for the burials that<lb/> same week were in the next adjoining parishes thus:—<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">table</hi> <hi rend="bold">rows</hi>="5" <hi rend="bold">cols</hi>="4"&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">row</hi> <hi rend="bold">role</hi>="data"&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">cell</hi> <hi rend="bold">role</hi>="label"&gt;St. Leonard's, Shoreditch&lt;/<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;64&lt;/<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;84&lt;/<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;119&lt;/<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">row</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">row</hi> <hi rend="bold">role</hi>="data"&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">cell</hi> <hi rend="bold">role</hi>="label"&gt;St. Botolph's, Bishopsgate&lt;/<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;65&lt;/<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;105&lt;/<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;116&lt;/<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">row</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">row</hi> <hi rend="bold">role</hi>="data"&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">cell</hi> <hi rend="bold">role</hi>="label"&gt;St. Giles's, Cripplegate&lt;/<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;213&lt;/<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;421&lt;/<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;554&lt;/<hi rend="bold">cell</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">row</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">table</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;This shutting up of houses was at first counted a very cruel<lb/> and unchristian method, and the poor people so confined made<lb/> bitter lamentations. ... &lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;</p><p><anchor xml:id="U5-figs"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1030"/>Figures and Graphics</p><p>Not all the components of a document are necessarily textual. The most straightforward text will often contain diagrams or illustrations, to say nothing of documents in which image and text are inextricably intertwined, or electronic resources in which the two are complementary. </p><p>The encoder may simply record the presence of a graphic within the text, possibly with a brief description of its content, by using the elements described in this section. The same elements may also be used to embed digitized versions of the graphic within an electronic document. </p><p>Any textual information accompanying the graphic, such as a heading and/or caption, may be included within the &lt;figure&gt; element itself, in a &lt;head&gt; and one or more &lt;p&gt; elements, as may also any text appearing within the graphic itself. It is strongly recommended that a prose description of the image be supplied, as the content of a &lt;figDesc&gt; element, for the use of applications which are not able to render the graphic, and to render the document accessible to vision-impaired readers. (Such text is not normally considered part of the document proper.)</p><p>The simplest use for these elements is to mark the position of a graphic and provide a link to it, as in this example; </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">pb</hi> <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="412"/&gt;<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">graphic</hi> <hi rend="bold">url</hi>="p412fig.png"/&gt;<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">pb</hi> <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="413"/&gt;</p><p> This indicates that the graphic contained by the file p412fig.png appears between pages 412 and 413. </p><p>The &lt;graphic&gt; element can appear anywhere that textual content is permitted, within but not between paragraphs or headings. In the following example, the encoder has decided to treat a specific printer's ornament as a heading: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">graphic</hi><lb/>   <hi rend="bold">url</hi>="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/gants/Ornaments/Heads/hp-ral02.gif"/&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;</p><p>More usually, a graphic will have at the least an identifying title, which may be encoded using the &lt;head&gt; element, or a number of figures may be grouped together in a particular structure. It is also often convenient to include a brief description of the image. The &lt;figure&gt; element provides a means of wrapping one or more such elements together as a kind of graphic <hi rend="italic">block</hi>: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">figure</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">graphic</hi> <hi rend="bold">url</hi>="fessipic.png"/&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;Mr Fezziwig's Ball&lt;/<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">figDesc</hi>&gt;A Cruikshank engraving showing Mr Fezziwig leading<lb/>   a group of revellers.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">figDesc</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">figure</hi>&gt;</p><p>When a digitized version of the graphic concerned is available, it may be embedded at the appropriate point within the document in this way.</p><p><anchor xml:id="U5-anal"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1031"/>Interpretation and Analysis</p><p>It is often said that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> markup is a form of interpretation or analysis. While it is certainly difficult, and may be impossible, to distinguish firmly between <hi rend="italic">objective</hi> and <hi rend="italic">subjective</hi> information in any universal way, it remains true that judgments concerning the latter are typically regarded as more likely to provide controversy than those concerning the former. Many scholars therefore prefer to record such interpretations only if it is possible to alert the reader that they are considered more open to dispute, than the rest of the markup. This section describes some of the elements provided by the TEI scheme to meet this need. </p><p><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1032"/>Orthographic Sentences</p><p>Interpretation typically ranges across the whole of a text, with no particular respect to other structural units. A useful preliminary to intensive interpretation is therefore to segment the text into discrete and identifiable units, each of which can then bear a label for use as a sort of <hi rend="italic">canonical reference</hi>. To facilitate such uses, these units may not cross each other, nor nest within each other. They may conveniently be represented using the following element: </p><p>As the name suggests, the &lt;s&gt; element is most commonly used (in linguistic applications at least) for marking </p><p><hi rend="bold">orthographic sentences</hi></p><p>, that is, units defined by orthographic features such as punctuation. For example, the passage from <hi rend="italic">Jane Eyre</hi> discussed earlier might be divided into s-units as follows:</p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">pb</hi> <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="474"/&gt;<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="chapter" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="38"&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">s</hi> <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="001"&gt;Reader, I married him.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">s</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">s</hi> <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="002"&gt;A quiet wedding we had:&lt;/<hi rend="bold">s</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">s</hi> <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="003"&gt;he and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">s</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">s</hi> <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="004"&gt;When we got back from church, I went<lb/>     into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking<lb/>     the dinner, and John cleaning the knives,<lb/>     and I said —&lt;/<hi rend="bold">s</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt;<lb/>   &lt;<hi rend="bold">s</hi> <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="005"&gt;Mary, I have been married to Mr Rochester<lb/>       this morning.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">s</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;/<hi rend="bold">q</hi>&gt; ... &lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;</p><p> Note that &lt;s&gt; elements cannot nest: the beginning of one &lt;s&gt; element implies that the previous one has finished. When s-units are tagged as shown above, it is advisable to tag the entire text end-to-end, so that every word in the text being analysed will be contained by exactly one &lt;s&gt; element, whose identifier can then be used to specify a unique reference for it. If the identifiers used are unique within the document, then the <hi rend="italic">xml:id</hi> attribute might be used in preference to the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> used in the above example.</p><p><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1033"/>General-Purpose Interpretation Elements</p><p>A more general purpose segmentation element, the &lt;seg&gt; has already been introduced for use in identifying otherwise unmarked targets of cross references and hypertext links (see section 8); it identifies some phrase-level portion of text to which the encoder may assign a user-specified <hi rend="italic">type</hi>, as well as a unique identifier; it may thus be used to tag textual features for which there is no provision in the published TEI Guidelines.</p><p>For example, the Guidelines provide no <hi rend="italic">apostrophe</hi> element to mark parts of a literary text in which the narrator addresses the reader (or hearer) directly. One approach might be to regard these as instances of the &lt;q&gt; element, distinguished from others by an appropriate value for the <hi rend="italic">who</hi> attribute. A possibly simpler, and certainly more general, solution would however be to use the &lt;seg&gt; element as follows: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="chapter" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="38"&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">seg</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="apostrophe"&gt;Reader, I married him.&lt;/<hi rend="bold">seg</hi>&gt;<lb/>   A quiet wedding we had: ...&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;</p><p> The <hi rend="italic">type</hi> attribute on the &lt;seg&gt; element can take any value, and so can be used to record phrase-level phenomena of any kind; it is good practice to record the values used and their significance in the header.</p><p>A &lt;seg&gt; element of one type (unlike the &lt;s&gt; element which it superficially resembles) can be nested within a &lt;seg&gt; element of the same or another type. This enables quite complex structures to be represented; some examples were given in section 8.3 above. However, because it must respect the requirement that elements be properly nested, and may not cut across each other, it cannot cope with the common requirement to associate an interpretation with arbitrary segments of a text which may completely ignore the document hierarchy. It also requires that the interpretation itself be represented by a single coded value in the <hi rend="italic">type</hi> attribute.</p><p>Neither restriction applies to the &lt;interp&gt; element, which provides powerful features for the encoding of quite complex interpretive information in a relatively straightforward manner. </p><p> These elements allows the encoder to specify both the class of an interpretation, and the particular instance of that class which the interpretation involves. Thus, whereas with &lt;seg&gt; one can say simply that something is an apostrophe, with &lt;interp&gt; one can say that it is an instance (apostrophe) of a larger class (rhetorical figures).</p><p>Moreover, &lt;interp&gt; is an empty element, which must be linked to the passage to which it applies either by means of the <hi rend="italic">ana</hi> attribute discussed in section 8.3 above, or by means of its own <hi rend="italic">inst</hi> attribute.

In the preparation of new documents (such as this one), XML has much to recommend it: the document's structure can be clearly represented, and the same electronic text can be re-used for many purposes — to provide both online hypertext or browsable versions and well-formatted typeset versions from a common source for example. </p><p>To facilitate this, the TEI Lite schema includes some elements for marking features of technical documents in general, and of XML-related documents in particular.</p><p><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1035"/>Additional Elements for Technical Documents</p><p>The following elements may be used to mark particular features of technical documents: </p><p>The following example shows how these elements might be used to encode a passage from a tutorial introducing the Fortran programming language: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;It is traditional to introduce a language with a program like the<lb/> following:<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">eg</hi>&gt; CHAR*12 GRTG<lb/>   GRTG = 'HELLO WORLD'<lb/>   PRINT *, GRTG<lb/>   END<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">eg</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">p</hi>&gt;This simple example first declares a variable &lt;<hi rend="bold">ident</hi>&gt;GRTG&lt;/<hi rend="bold">ident</hi>&gt;, in<lb/> the line &lt;<hi rend="bold">code</hi>&gt;CHAR*12 GRTG&lt;/<hi rend="bold">code</hi>&gt;, which identifies &lt;<hi rend="bold">ident</hi>&gt;GRTG&lt;/<hi rend="bold">ident</hi>&gt;<lb/> as consisting of 12 bytes of type &lt;<hi rend="bold">ident</hi>&gt;CHAR&lt;/<hi rend="bold">ident</hi>&gt;.

Similarly, the use of tags such as &lt;ident&gt; greatly facilitates the construction of a useful index.</p><p>The &lt;formula&gt; element should be used to enclose a mathematical or chemical formula presented within the text as a distinct item. Since formulae generally include a large variety of special typographic features not otherwise present in ordinary text, it will usually be necessary to present the body of the formula in a specialized notation. The notation used should be specified by the <hi rend="italic">notation</hi> attribute, as in the following example: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">formula</hi> <hi rend="bold">notation</hi>="tex"&gt; \begin{math}E = mc^{2}\end{math}<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">formula</hi>&gt;</p><p>A particular problem arises when XML encoding is the subject of discussion within a technical document, itself encoded in XML. In such a document, it is clearly essential to distinguish clearly the markup occurring within examples from that marking up the document itself, and end-tags are highly likely to occur. One simple solution is to use the predefined entity reference &amp;lt; to represent each &lt; character which marks the start of an XML tag within the examples. A more general solution is to mark off the whole body of each example as containing data which is not to be scanned for XML mark-up by the parser. This is achieved by enclosing it within a special XML construct called a </p><p>CDATA<hi rend="bold" xml:space="preserve"> marked section</hi></p><p>, as in the following example: </p><p rend="egXML">&lt;p&gt;A list should be encoded as follows:<lb/>&lt;eg&gt;&lt;![ CDATA [<lb/> &lt;list&gt;<lb/> &lt;item&gt;First item in the list&lt;/item&gt;<lb/> &lt;item&gt;Second item&lt;/item&gt;<lb/> &lt;/list&gt;<lb/>]]&gt;<lb/>&lt;/eg&gt;<lb/>The &lt;gi&gt;list&lt;/gi&gt; element consists of a series of &lt;gi&gt;item&lt;/gi&gt;<lb/>elements.</p><p>The &lt;list&gt; element used within the example above will not be regarded as forming part of the document proper, because it is embedded within a marked section (beginning with the special markup declaration &lt;![CDATA[ , and ending with ]]&gt;).</p><p>Note also the use of the &lt;gi&gt; element to tag references to element names (or </p><p><hi rend="bold">generic identifiers</hi></p><p>) within the body of the text.</p><p><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1036"/>Generated Divisions</p><p>Most modern document production systems have the ability to generate automatically whole sections such as a table of contents or an index. The TEI Lite scheme provides an element to mark the location at which such a generated section should be placed. </p><p>The &lt;divGen&gt; element can be placed anywhere that a division element would be legal, as in the following example: </p><p>&lt;<hi rend="bold">front</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">titlePage</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">titlePage</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">divGen</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="toc"/&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;Preface&lt;/<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">front</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">body</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">body</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">back</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;Appendix&lt;/<hi rend="bold">head</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">div</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">divGen</hi> <hi rend="bold">type</hi>="index" <hi rend="bold">n</hi>="Index"/&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">back</hi>&gt;</p><p>This example also demonstrates the use of the <hi rend="italic">type</hi> attribute to distinguish the different kinds of division to be generated: in the first case a table of contents (a toc) and in the second an index.</p><p>When an existing index or table of contents is to be encoded (rather than one being generated) for some reason, the &lt;list&gt; element discussed in section 11 should be used. </p><p><anchor xml:id="indexing"/><anchor xml:id="SECTION_1037"/>Index Generation</p><p>While production of a table of contents from a properly tagged document is generally unproblematic for an automatic processor, the production of a good quality index will often require more careful tagging. It may not be enough simply to produce a list of all parts tagged in some particular way, although extracting (for example) all occurrences of elements such as &lt;term&gt; or &lt;name&gt; will often be a good departure point for an index. </p><p>The TEI schema provides a special purpose &lt;index&gt; tag which may be used to mark both the parts of the document which should be indexed, and how the indexing should be done. </p><p>For example, the second paragraph of this section might include the following:</p><p>...<lb/> TEI lite also provides a special purpose &lt;<hi rend="bold">gi</hi>&gt;index&lt;/<hi rend="bold">gi</hi>&gt; tag<lb/><lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">index</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">term</hi>&gt;indexing&lt;/<hi rend="bold">term</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">index</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;<hi rend="bold">index</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">term</hi>&gt;index (tag)&lt;/<hi rend="bold">term</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;<hi rend="bold">index</hi>&gt;<lb/>  &lt;<hi rend="bold">term</hi>&gt;use in index generation&lt;/<hi rend="bold">term</hi>&gt;<lb/> &lt;/<hi rend="bold">index</hi>&gt;<lb/>&lt;/<hi rend="bold">index</hi>&gt;<lb/> which may be used ...</p><p>The &lt;index&gt; element can also be used to provide a form of interpretive or analytic information. For example, in a study of Ovid, it might be desired to record all the poet's references to different figures, for comparative stylistic study. In the following lines of the <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi>, such a study would record the poet's references to Jupiter (as deus, se, and as the subject of confiteor [in inflectional form number 227]), to Jupiter-in-the-guise-of-a-bull (as imago tauri fallacis and the subject of teneo), and so on.<note place="foot" xml:id="ftn2" n="2"><p> The analysis is taken, with permission, from Willard McCarty and Burton Wright, <hi rend="italic">An Analytical Onomasticon to the Metamorphoses of Ovid</hi> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, forthcoming).
